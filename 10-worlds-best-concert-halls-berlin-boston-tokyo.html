While venues might be designed for a resident orchestra, without pop concerts and comedy shows many would struggle to balance the books. The long reverberance that enhances the orchestral sound can turn pop music and speech into a muddy cacophony. Most halls therefore have some way of changing the acoustics. In Lucerne, this is done via a giant reverberation chamber that wraps around the outside of the hall. For organ and choral music, the access doors are opened to mimic the acoustic characteristics of a cathedral.<br><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> +41 41 226 7777, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">kkl-luzern.ch</a>.

The shoebox shape was inspired by the old <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Gewandhaus in Leipzig</a>. But copying features of an old hall does not ensure a great venue. The sublime acoustics of Symphony Hall – in the heart of the city and on one of its main thoroughfares, Massachusetts Avenue – is down to <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Wallace Clement Sabine</a>, a physics professor from Harvard University.

The breathing and fidgeting of the audience actually creates more sound than other background noises. Only in intense moments where the audience collectively hold its breath, can this deep silence be heard. Take a backstage tour of the Bridgewater Hall, and you will be told the story of the IRA bomb that on 15 June 1996 broke virtually every window in the city centre. The hall is so well isolated that construction workers inside the auditorium did not hear the explosion. The venue held its first performance in September 1996 and now has three resident orchestras: <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the Hallé</a>, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the BBC Philharmonic</a> and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Manchester Camerata</a>.<br><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> 0844 907 9000, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">bridgewater-hall.co.uk</a>.

When the Philharmonic plays a sweeping crescendo, it is as though the hall springs into life.

By breaking the audience into blocks, the intervening walls can be used to reflect more sound to the audience from the sides. Scharoun noted that “people always gather in circles when listening to music informally”, and this inspired the radical concept of music in the round. About a third of the audience is behind the orchestra.

The walls and balconies form sweeping curves, and from the ceiling hang clouds of panels looking like they have been cut out from giant planks of wood. But these curves are not just strokes of the architect’s pen to create visual beauty, every surface is carefully shaped to provide enhancing sound reflections into the audience. The Philharmonie is not a facsimile of an old venerated hall, but an auditorium of its time, one that could only be built now by exploiting modern acoustic engineering. As well as enjoying concerts, visitors can also explore musical heritage, as the venue <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">features a museum</a> that retraces the history of music from the 17th century to today through the popular instruments used to create it.<br><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> +33 1 44 84 4484, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">philharmoniedeparis.fr</a></p><h2 id=the-sibelius-hall-lahti-finland>The Sibelius Hall, Lahti, Finland</h2><figure id=a8b1e317-08d0-449e-8e9a-ef84e3bb6d87 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Opening of the Sibelius Hall.</span> Photograph: Lehtikuva Oy/Rex</figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Another entrant in the modern category of concert halls, the Sibelius Hall was only completed in 2000 but its design and acoustic ethos have earned it many plaudits. On the harbour in Lahti, the former industrial heartland of the city, the hall is less than an hour’s train ride from Helsinki – and the journey is well worth it. Many auditoria have wooden walls around the stage, but the Sibelius Hall goes one step further by using timber throughout the construction. There is a common misconception that the wooden walls of auditoria vibrate like the body of a violin to create a beautiful sound: in reality, every note the orchestra makes needs nurturing so it can reverberate around the hall. Vibrating walls would just take sound away. The wood in a grand auditorium is either very thick or is just a thin veneer glued solidly onto concrete so the sounds reflect efficiently.<br><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> +358 600 39 3949, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">sibeliustalo.fi</a>.

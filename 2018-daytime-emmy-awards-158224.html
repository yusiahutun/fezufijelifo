And as the gala event nears, we’ve got answers to all your burning questions about <a href=#>this year’s ceremony</a>!</p><h2>When are the 2018 Daytime Emmys?</h2><p>The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) has revealed that the Daytime Emmy Awards will be held on Sunday, April 29. The Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards will be held two days earlier on Friday, April 27.</p><h2>Where are the Daytime Emmys being held?</h2><p>Both the Daytime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards are being held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, CA. “The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences is excited to be moving our signature show to the historic Pasadena Civic Center,” said Chuck Dages, Chairman of NATAS, last year. “With its grand lobby and world-class architecture, it is a fitting location for the Daytime Emmy Awards.”</p><h2>How can I watch the 2018 Daytime Emmys?</h2><p>This year, the Daytime Emmy Awards will again be available to stream online via the <a href=#>Emmy website</a> as well as their Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, but now they will also be broadcast on KNEKT TV so that the show can be easily watched on television via a free app. For more details, just <a href=#>click here</a>! Like last year’s ceremony, there will be a red carpet pre-show hosted by <a href=#>General Hospital</a>‘s Carolyn Hennesy. The last time the Daytime Emmys were broadcast on television was back in 2015, when cable network Pop aired the ceremony following 2014’s ill-fated webcast attempt.</p><p>The 2016 ceremony was not aired or streamed but made available for online viewing the following day. Although if you live near Pasadena, you could always just <a href=#>purchase tickets</a> to attend the ceremony in person! Select seats are available for purchase, so you can experience the excitement first-hand!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/general-hospital-cast.jpg><p>The General Hospital cast at the 2017 Daytime Emmys.</p><h2>Who is nominated for a Daytime Emmy?</h2><p>The major categories were announced live on <a href=#>The Talk</a> on March 21, and a full list of nominees can be found by <a href=#>clicking here</a>. And the Emmy committee has released the reels so fans can see exactly what scenes the stars submitted to earn those nominations and hopefully the win for the categories of Outstanding Younger Actress, Outstanding Younger Actor, Outstanding Supporting Actress, Outstanding Supporting Actor, Lead Actress, and Lead Actor.</p><h2>Who is receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award?</h2><p>Days of our Lives veterans Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes will be honored with Lifetime Achievement Awards at Sunday evening’s ceremony.

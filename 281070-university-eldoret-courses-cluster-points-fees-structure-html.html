The university was founded in 1946 as a Large-scale farming Training Center for white settlers and was converted into a teacher’s training college in 1984 under the name Moi Teachers Training College. The college was taken over by the Moi University in 1990 due to the double intake crisis and named the Chepkoilel Campus. In February, 2013, the institution was granted a charter by the president and became the University of Eldoret. Ever since, the University of Eldoret courses and programs have expanded to meet student needs and workforce demand in Kenya.

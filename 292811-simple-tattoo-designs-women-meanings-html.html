There is no need to have a tattoo if you are going to hide it. Here are some of the best tattoo designs for girls to put on their hands.</p><h3><strong>1.Tribal hand tattoo</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Here is a good example of a hand tattoo for women. It is a tribal tattoo so there is more to it than what meets the eye. It is a tattoo of what looks like a red Indian lady and a wolf. I think that is a clear illustration of the beast within. The wolf is a symbol of guardianship, ritual, loyalty, and spirit. The woman is implying she is all that. This is just an amazing hand tattoo.</p><h3><strong>2. Cute dog tattoo</strong></h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a11d565f503c425e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>150+ best comments for a boy's pic on Instagram to compliment him</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Every body knows dogs represent loyalty. This then brings so much meaning to this particular tattoo. Underneath the dog there is the word 'FAMILY'. This word is not there just for the sake or just because they needed to fill up space. This tattoo generally means that family is all about loyalty. If that is not deep I don't know what deep is.</p><h3><strong>3. Did somebody say music</strong></h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the most popular tattoo designs not only for women but also men. Music is a universal language and as they say, the best thing is that when music hits you, you feel no pain. This tattoo is for all the music lovers.</p><h2>Tattoo designs for women's wrist</h2><p class=align-left>Most of the tattoos usually put on the wrist as usually small due to the size of the wrist. Here are some tattoo designs for women to put on heir wrists.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1b139a35eb5f03a4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best small forearm tattoos for men with meanings</span></p></a><h3><strong>1. Thorns and roses tattoo</strong></h3><p class=align-left>If you have never seen beauty and the beast then you are not likely to identify with this tattoo. This tattoo is a clear representation of beauty which is represented by the rose. It is also a clear representation of the beast which is represented by the thorns. It basically means we have our good side and our bad side, our beauty and our flaws but all in all, our beauty and our flaws are what make us who we are.</p><h3><strong>2. Roses for love</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Roses are usually a clear indication of love. We see roses almost everywhere during Valentines Day. Do you think that is by coincidence? This tattoo is of a roses flower that has the word 'love' as the flower's stalk. Love upon love.</p><h3><strong>3. For all the dog lovers</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Whoever said that the dog is mans best friend was truly right. Dogs are very nice animals. They guard us and they are very playful. The tattoo above is a good him and her tattoo. The guy would do the male dog and the girl the female dog. Apart from all that, we have to agree these are just very cute tattoos.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54c257078ed60f4f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to tell if your baby mama still loves you</span></p></a><h3><strong>4. Le' familia</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Family is very important. You can't live without them and sometimes it seems almost impossible to live with them. This tattoo represents family, the strongest bond in the world. Stronger than chemical bonds, because no matter what you do, your family will always be your family. From the tattoo, you can see that two of the birds at the extreme ends are slightly bigger than the other birds. This is a clear representation of a nuclear family. Father, mother and the children. This is a tattoo a mother would definitely get and for sure I wouldn't mind my mum rocking this tattoo.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Tribal African tattoos and their meanings</strong></p><h3><strong>5. A name tattoo</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Name tattoos are very common. This is because most human beings love themselves and this is a clear indication of self-love. If you can't love yourself, how can you love others?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8f6330630dd06d90.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful no makeup quotes and sayings on natural beauty</span></p></a><h3><strong>6.

This is because many different people have different things that they live for. There are people who love their spouses with everything they are and everything they've got. For this reason, their spouse is their heart beat. For others, music is their heat beat. This tattoo symbolizes that one thing that we live for, that one thing that keeps us going.</p><h2>Tattoo designs for ladies' feet</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, the feet. I know most of you have never seen this. Well, that's because it is hard to see feet tattoos as most of the time the feet are usually hidden by the shoes. This however does not mean they are unicorns, they do exist. Most people that usually put tattoos on their feet usually want to hide the tattoo or as most of them say, keep the tattoos to themselves. Here are some tattoo ideas for girls and women to put on their feet.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56cb6da808e0d38a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 trendy haircuts for women that will make you look younger</span></p></a><h3><strong>1.

I know we are many. When you look closely at the tattoo there is a love symbol followed by the words,' TO SEE YOU'. This basically means I would love to see you. If I love seeing you to the point I put a tattoo saying that, then I am sure my love for you is as permanent as the tattoo. So, when can I see you again?</p><h3><strong>2. Flowers for my feet</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54c257078ed60f4f.jpg><p class=align-left>This tattoo would look very nice in scandals or some open shoes so that everyone can see how beautiful your feet are.

Isn't that such a beautiful sight? I know most men will agree with me on this. Most ladies who put tattoos on their legs usually like wearing slightly short dresses and skirts. Here are some amazing tattoo designs to put on those legs.</p><h3><strong>1. Cute pink rose tattoo</strong></h3><p class=align-left>This is just the next generation tattoo.

Phoenix tattoo</strong></h3><p class=align-left>This is a tattoo of the phoenix bird. This tattoo has a very deep meaning. It means that she has risen from the flames as a winner, beating all life challenges and defeating hard times. The phoenix is a symbol of rebirth from the ashes of the past, and it also represents the victory of life over death, thus immortality.</p><h3><strong>2. Beauty from within</strong></h3><p class=align-left>We all need to meditate. Once in awhile, it is nice to listen to your soul. This tattoo symbolizes balance. Balance of the inside and the outside.

There are many people who tattoo themselves different phrases. We all have phrases that we live by and this is a sure way of making sure you never forget what you live by. This tattoo says 'I am the architect of my own destruction'. This means if she fails, she is to blame for it. It is being accountable to yourself. If she also succeeds it is because of herself. This woman has clearly taken control of her life. Are you in control of your life or are you still blaming people for your doings?</p><h3><strong>4. Yin-Yang tattoo</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d65ebbdcce665ff3.jpg><p class=align-left>This tattoo originated from Asia. It has a couple of meanings to it. It is usually a circle with two 'halves' for lack of a better word to describe the two segments. One half is black with a small white circle and the other half is white with a small black circle. This tattoo first of all means balance as there is equal black and white in it. It also means the balance in the good (white) and evil(black). The Yin-Yang also means that there is good in the bad and there is bad in the good, that is why there is a white circle in the black segment and vice versa.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d6e13f0cd72c411.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 best savage quotes for girls</span></p></a><h2>Tattoo designs for women's necks</h2><p class=align-left>These tattoos are usually small but can be made long.

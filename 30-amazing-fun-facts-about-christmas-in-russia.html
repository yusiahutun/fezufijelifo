Unlike many countries where December 25th marks the day of celebration, Russian Christmas traditions follow the Julian calendar, with festivities taking place on January 7th. This difference in dates is just the beginning of what makes Christmas in Russia so special.</p><li><p><strong>Christmas Eve</strong> in Russia, known as <strong>Sochelnik</strong>, involves a family dinner that starts only after the first star appears in the sky, symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem. This meal is traditionally meatless but rich in variety, featuring twelve dishes that represent the twelve apostles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kutya</strong> is a ceremonial grain dish with honey and poppy seeds, often the first of the twelve dishes served during the Christmas Eve dinner. It's not just food; it's a symbol of hope and immortality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Attending Midnight Mass</strong> is a significant part of the celebration for many Russians.

Its ingredients, including potatoes, carrots, peas, eggs, and mayonnaise, are simple, but the dish is a beloved part of the holiday feast.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selyodka Pod Shuboy</strong>, or herring under a fur coat, is another traditional dish. This layered salad includes herring, potatoes, carrots, beetroot, and mayonnaise, symbolizing prosperity and richness in the coming year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vzvar</strong>, a traditional Christmas beverage, is made by boiling dried fruits and honey. It's often served at the end of the Christmas Eve meal and is thought to bring health and happiness to the family.</p></li><h2 class=content-title id=title-4>Christmas Decorations and Symbols</h2><p>Decorations play a big part in setting the festive mood, with unique Russian touches.</p><li><p><strong>Handmade Decorations</strong> are common, with families often crafting their ornaments for the New Year Tree. These can include painted nuts, dried fruits, and paper crafts.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Star of Bethlehem</strong> is a prevalent symbol, often seen at the top of the New Year Tree or in decorations around the home. It represents the guiding light that led the Wise Men to Jesus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ice Sculptures</strong> are a common sight in public spaces during the festive season. Cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg host festivals where artists create intricate sculptures that last throughout the winter months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snowflakes</strong> are another popular decoration, symbolizing the winter season. They're often handmade from paper and hung in windows or on trees.</p></li><li><p><strong>Light Displays</strong> in city centers and public squares are breathtaking, with elaborate setups that illuminate the long winter nights.

This is because the Russian Orthodox Church follows the Julian calendar for religious celebrations. Also, Ded Moroz, or Father Frost, brings presents to children, accompanied by his granddaughter Snegurochka, the Snow Maiden, not on Christmas but on New Year's Eve.QWhy do Russians celebrate Christmas on January 7th?AThe reason behind this unique date lies in the Russian Orthodox Church's use of the Julian calendar for religious dates. The Julian calendar runs 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar, which is used by most of the world for civil purposes. Hence, December 25th on the Julian calendar falls on January 7th on the Gregorian calendar.QWho are Ded Moroz and Snegurochka?ADed Moroz, or Father Frost, is the Slavic counterpart to Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas. Unlike his Western counterparts, he makes his rounds on New Year's Eve. Snegurochka, his granddaughter, known as the Snow Maiden, helps him distribute gifts. Together, they play a central role in New Year's celebrations, which are more prominent than Christmas festivities in Russia.QIs Christmas a big holiday in Russia?AWhile Christmas is celebrated in Russia, it's not as commercially significant as New Year's Eve. After the 1917 revolution, Christmas celebrations were discouraged by the Soviet regime, and many Christmas traditions were shifted to New Year's Eve. However, since the fall of the Soviet Union, Christmas has seen a revival, but New Year's remains the main winter holiday.QWhat traditional foods are eaten during Russian Christmas?AOn Christmas Eve, Russians observe a traditional fast, breaking it only when the first star appears in the night sky, symbolizing the birth of Jesus. The Christmas meal often includes dishes like kutya (a sweet grain pudding with honey, poppy seeds, and dried fruits), borscht (beet soup), and various fish dishes. Meat dishes and more elaborate feasts are saved for New Year's celebrations.QHow do Russians decorate for Christmas?ADecorations in Russia lean towards New Year's celebrations, with New Year trees (Novogodnaya Yolka) taking center stage instead of Christmas trees. These trees are adorned with lights, ornaments, and topped with a star. Cities sparkle with festive lights and decorations, creating a magical winter atmosphere. Traditional Christmas symbols, like Nativity scenes, are more commonly found in churches and homes of the devout.QCan tourists experience traditional Russian Christmas celebrations?AYes, tourists can immerse themselves in traditional Russian Christmas celebrations, especially in cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg. Many churches hold midnight services on January 6th, leading into Christmas Day. Festivals, concerts, and public events also take place, offering visitors a glimpse into Russia's rich cultural heritage during this festive season.<h3>Was this page helpful?</h3><p class=why-trust><span>Our commitment to delivering trustworthy and engaging content is at the heart of what we do.

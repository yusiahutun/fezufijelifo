Although her mother was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">single parent</a>, she gave Tamron and her sister the best life. When her mother remarried, the broadcaster and her sister quickly adapted to the new life. However, Tamron Hall’s parents did not move out of Texas.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5bb71e413a456abf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tamron Hall and Lawrence O'Donnell relationship, split, dating history</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She attended different Luling schools in Texas before going to Pennsylvania for college.

She shortly worked at Dallas-Fort as a fresh graduate before relocating to Bryan in Texas.</p><p class=align-left>What ethnicity is Tamron Hall? The TV star is an Afro-American. Apart from being open about her ethnicity in her shows, Tamron is part of the National Association of Black Journalists. As a member of the association, she is vocal on black stories, especially in the entertainment scene.</p><p class=align-left>Is Tamron Hall related to Arsenio Hall? While the two talk show hosts share the last name, they are not related. Arsenio is from Cleveland, Ohio, while Tamron is from Texas. Besides being from different states, they have never pointed in any of their interviews that they are related.</p><h2>Love life and parenthood</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5bb71e413a456abf.jpeg><p class=align-left>The TV star married Steven Greener in 2019 in a private wedding ceremony. The main reason for opting a private wedding was because of Greener’s personality. Apart from being a lover of privacy, Tamron Hall’s husband is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">music executive</a>. Since then, the two have been seen together on multiple occasions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5b216546e5d7d1cd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nicolle Wallace and Michael Schmidt relationship: What you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>While rumours of alleged Tamron Hall’s daughter have been floating on the internet for decades, the TV star does not have a daughter. However, she is a mother of one. Her son <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Moses</a> was born in 2019. However, her announcement came as a surprise. Tamron Hall had opted to keep details about her pregnancy private because of many reasons.</p><p class=align-left>The TV host <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told People Magazine</a> that the main reason why she kept details about her pregnancy private was the fear of losing the child. Since Tamron was 48 when she gave birth, her biggest fear at the time was a miscarriage.</p><h2>Work and career highlights</h2><p class=align-left>After graduating from college in 1992, Tamron worked in different media houses in different capacities. Some of her career highlights in the past three decades include:</p><h3>As a reporter, anchor, and TV host (on MSNBC and NBC News)</h3><p class=align-left>From 2007 to 2017, Tamron Hall was one of the most influential media personalities on MSNBC and NBC. She worked as a News reporter and fill-in anchor for different shows. Also, her interviews before the 2008 elections were unmatched.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/db84ff8293070319.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is Hallie Jackson married?

While the then-presidential aspirant had a ground in the Democratic Party, the interview changed the national perception of what Obama stood for, as a leader.</p><p class=align-left>Thanks to her unrivalled interviewing skills, Tamron started <i>NewsNation</i>. In her show, she conducted high-profile interviews that redefined global and national politics in the USA. She also reported the news. For example, when Osama Bin Laden was killed, she was one of the broadcasters that broke the news to the world.</p><h3>As the <i>Today</i> show co-anchor</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d02190b0c10de8b.jpg><p class=align-left>After an impressive year in 2013, Tamron joined the <i>Today</i> show as a co-host. She became the first woman of colour to co-anchor the show. The talented broadcaster worked with Natalie Morales, Willie Geist, and <a href=#>Al Roker</a>. However, after three years, she unexpectedly left the show.</p><p class=align-left>Why did Tamron leave the <i>Today</i> show? While the broadcaster has never talked about why she left the show, there have been speculations that her exit was because of the show creators bringing Megyn Kelly as the main anchor. The changes meant that the Texas-born broadcaster was to take a “lesser role” on the show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6a734396864582ea.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Comedian Kristen Schaal net worth, husband, voices, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The changes did not sit well with Tamron, and she decided to end her contract with NBC and the show. Thanks to her experience co-hosting the show, she started her talk show, with a similar approach in 2019.</p><h3>As the host of the <i>Tamron Hall Show</i></h3><p class=align-left>In 2019, the broadcaster premiered the <i>Tamron Hall Show</i>. The show’s signature for the past two years has been topical issues and entertaining conversations. However, the show disappeared on the show for two months in 2020.</p><p class=align-left>Did the <i>Tamron Hall Show</i> get cancelled? No. However, the production was suspended due to the <a href=#>pandemic</a>. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Deadline</a>, the halting of production was not new as other similar talk shows had earlier taken a similar break.</p><p class=align-left>However, after a few months of being off-air, the show returned. In the new format, most of the interviews are through video calls. Other than the guests interacting with the virtual audience, Tamron continues to be the show’s main creator.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0392214a50593119.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Annamarie Tendler bio: height, net worth, wedding, parents, what happened</span></p></a><h3>Tamron as an anti-domestic violence campaigner</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5b216546e5d7d1cd.jpg><p class=align-left>While the murder of her sister Renate is still a mystery — regarding who did it — it opened the TV star’s eyes to the increasing numbers of domestic violence cases. In 2014, she launched the popular campaigned dubbed <i>Shine a Light</i>. Apart from raising funds for the affected victims, the TV star tours schools and colleges across the USA spreading awareness.</p><p class=align-left>She has also worked with other institutions in her anti-domestic violence campaigns. For example, Tamron worked with Day One New York in their fundraising efforts. Thanks to her mobilisation skills, the institution raised <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">over $40,000</a>.</p><h2>Net worth and income streams</h2><p class=align-left>According to Celebrity Net Worth, the TV host is worth <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$5 million</a>. Tamron has worked in the media space for more than two decades, and therefore, her net worth is mainly from her salary.</p><p class=align-left>In a 2016 article in the New York Times, Tamron <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared details</a> about her home then.

However, most of the pictures show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one part</a> of the home as opposed to the whole house. Therefore, it is hard to evaluate the value of her current home.</p><p class=align-left>Tamron Hall is, without a doubt, one of the most influential broadcasters of our time. Besides working for big media houses such as MSNBC and NBC, she defiled the status quo by being the first woman of colour to host the <i>Today</i> show.

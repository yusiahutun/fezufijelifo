Mostly, the colour is more prevalent in Africa, Asia, and in some other parts of the globe, such as Eastern and Southern Europe, America, and Latin America.</p><p class=align-left>In this regard, many people tend to overlook the occurrence of some rare natural hair colors. In some instances, some term them as congenital disabilities, which is scientifically incorrect.

Out of the four, black is the most common one. Below is a comprehensive summary of the unusual natural hair colors, and their percentage distribution in the world’s population:</p><h3>1. Red hair – 1 to 2%</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8327bbc4c93a0ce1.jpg><p class=align-left>Red-haired people have the strangest natural hair color on the planet. The occurrence is most common in Ireland and Scotland. According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Healthline</a></i>, both parents must have the gene for red hair to be expressed in their offspring. It is so because the gene for red-head is recessive.</p><p class=align-left>Also, the possibility of it being expressed is low even when both parents carry it. Interestingly, such a couple is likely to have one out of four of their children being redheads. As a result, scientists estimate that around 1 to 2% of the global population is made of redheads.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f1e24c98099a64fb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of all black crystals and their meanings spiritually</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The redness can vary from bright copper, deep burgundy, red-orange, auburn, Burt orange to strawberry blonde. So, is strawberry blonde the rarest hair color? Yes, it rare to find someone with that tone.</p><h3>2. Blonde hair – 3%</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/50771d733d54ba0c.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=#>Blonde hair</a> is another most unique hair color in the world. It is characterized by low pigmentation of the eumelanin. Blondes make up 3% of the world’s total population.</p><p class=align-left>They are commonly found in Northern Europe and Asia. Note that the shade may vary from ash, dirty platinum, strawberry, honey to golden.</p><p class=align-left>In most instances, the number of blondes is perceived to be high in the world. However, that is not the case – most cases, especially in <a href=#>movies</a>, aren’t natural. To achieve this recessive trait, all your parents must have brown alleles.</p><h3>3. Brown hair – 11%</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f1e24c98099a64fb.jpg><p class=align-left>Brown-haired people are not common in some parts of the planet. However, they come in position three in the group of individuals with strange natural hair colors.

Unlike red hair, brown hair is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dominant trait</a>. This implies that either your mother or father must have blonde hair for you to have one. The attribute can be expressed when there is one allele for brown hair in your parents’ DNA.</p><h3>4. Black – 75 to 85%</h3><p class=align-left><a href=#>Black hair</a>, unlike others, is the most common in most parts of the world. Generally, black-haired people make up 75 to 85% of the world’s population. In most instances, people with such hair are found in Africa, Asia, America, Latin America, Southern, and Eastern Europe.</p><p class=align-left>These individuals’ skin tones can vary from a dark brunette, soft black, to jet black. As a result, it cannot be classified under weird hair colors due to its commonness.</p><h2>Rarest hair colors and eye combinations</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/563c069fb86fc9de.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A compilation of some of the most exclusive night clubs in the world</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Similar to hair, there are people with rare eye colours. Some of the known unique/rare eye colours are blue, green, amber, and hazel. Therefore, now that you know all the rarest hair colours, you may find it worthwhile knowing the unique hair colors and eye colours combination. They include:</p><h3>1. Red hair and blue eyes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/554e7c14156da859.jpg><p class=align-left>Red-haired and blue-eyed individuals are the rarest combination you can find on the planet. Similar to red hair, blue eyes are genetically recessive. In other words, all parents must have the alleles for blue eyes for the trait to be expressed.</p><p class=align-left>According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Word Atlas</a></i>, blue-eyed people make up around 8 to 10% of the world’s population. People with blue eyes are said to have a common ancestry. Based on science, the possibility of the combination happening is considerably low.</p><h3>2. Red hair and green eyes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e80c51e1ed654f4.jpg><p class=align-left>By now, you are aware that red-headed individuals are rare to find. The same applies to green-eyed people. Several sources estimate that 2% of the world’s population comprises people with green eyes. The combination is rare because recessive alleles carry the traits.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aa3df72b4f2451bc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Which are 10 most expensive woods in the world?</span></p></a><h3>3.

Likewise, blue eyes are an unlikely occurrence that comes about due to genetic mutation. The majority of such people are found in Europe. According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Tech Interactive</a></i>, a brown-haired and brown-eyed couple can give birth to a child with blonde hair and blue eyes.</p><h3>4. Blonde hair and green eyes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/563c069fb86fc9de.jpg><p class=align-left>Blonde hair, green eyes are other unique and rare combinations. Usually, blue eyes scatter some light, appearing green. The same applies to blue eyes. The precise percentage of this group of people is not known yet, but they are believed to occupy a small percentage of the world’s total population.</p><h3>5. Brown hair and hazel or amber eyes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8e9f5fd6d2e847e8.jpg><p class=align-left>Another rare combo is brown hair and hazel/amber eyes. Based on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">latest statistics</a>, the percentage of hazel and amber-eyed people on the planet is the same – 5%. Considering the population of brown-headed people is relatively small, a combination of either of the two eye colours becomes rare.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ae6be87726796b1a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 most dangerous jungles in the world</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What are your thoughts about the above rarest hair colors and eye combinations in humans?

Over time, that feeling will probably fade, especially if you never see or hear from him. But if he does contact you, asks about you or talks about you to other people, then there’s a good chance he knows he’s made a mistake and wants you back. What are the top signs that show your baby daddy wants you back but is scared to tell you?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpg><p class=align-left>You deserve to have a stable, secure, and healthy relationship with someone who genuinely loves you. Before you entertain any ideas of getting back together with your baby daddy, you need to determine if it’s really what you want and that you’re not going back to a relationship that was toxic and unhealthy.</p><h2>Signs your baby daddy wants you back</h2><p class=align-left>You don't deserve to be in a relationship that is no longer making you happy. However, if you think that there's a chance that you can build a loving, honest, and healthy relationship with your ex, then it's worth giving a try. Here are signs that your baby daddy wants you back:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c703037053dfd81a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 sure signs she wants a serious relationship with you</span></p></a><h3>1. He moved on too fast</h3><p class=align-left>Moving on too fast is one of the signs he wants you back after a breakup. It takes time to move on after a relationship is over. No one is immediately over it, especially if the relationship lasted for years and a baby was born in the process.</p><p class=align-left>Feelings for a baby mama cannot go away overnight. If he is moving on and dating someone else after a couple of days, he is not ready for that. He might not forget about you just because he is in a new relationship.</p><h3>2. He makes excuses to come and see his kid</h3><p class=align-left>Chances are you two have already talked about when he will be coming to see the kid or picking him/her for an outing. If you all know the specific days or time your baby daddy is supposed to come over, but he visits more often, that is a big sign.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Giving an excuse to come over once or twice to see his kid is normal. But more than two times, that would need an explanation. Guys like to pull this move when they cannot let their baby mama go. They want to keep seeing her, but their ego can't allow them to ask them for make-up.</p><h3>3. He drunk calls you</h3><p class=align-left>When people are drunk, their inhibitions are lowered, their super-ego takes a leave, and their real identity comes out in a big way. As a result, most of them end up speaking nothing but the truth. This is one of the huge signs he wants you back but is scared. It is only his sober mind defences that are preventing him from looking for a way to reconnect.</p><h3>4. He publicly shows how depressed he is</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c703037053dfd81a.jpg><p class=align-left>If he shows everyone how depressed he is, it is a strategy to get you concerned about his wellbeing. If he were done with loving you, he would never let you know how depressed he is because that would be embarrassing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If he wants you back, he will try to portray how sad and depressed he is. So, if you see him telling the <a href=#>world</a> that he is depressed, it is a clear sign that he still loves you and wants you back.</p><p class=align-left>He might post his sad and depressed feelings on social media or use other ways to make sure you know how depressed he is. This means he wants you back, but he is scared of making a move first.</p><h3>5. He is still protecting you</h3><p class=align-left>Although you don’t leave together, he might be displaying protective behaviour towards you. How do you tell if he wants to get back together? Which protective behaviours depict that he loves you?</p><p class=align-left>If he is concerned about your safety and wellbeing, that can be a great sign. The same applies if he protects you against things that can harm you. He is supposed to be concerned more about the kid and not you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf339000f4853033.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to stop loving the father of your child as a single mom</span></p></a><h3>6. He stays in touch, even when you are cold</h3><p class=align-left>If you dump your baby daddy, you can either keep in touch with him as much as possible or get cold on him. Getting cold means that you don’t take his calls or reply to his messages. Most of the time, you will get cold. It is hard, but it is the best way to respond when someone you love hurts you.</p><p class=align-left>In turn, your baby daddy will stop contacting you. He will only be reaching out when he wants to see his kid. But what if, even though you are cold on him, he keeps getting in touch? This is the clearest sign that he is not ready to give up on you.</p><h3>7. He asks mutual friends about you</h3><p class=align-left>If you have mutual friends, he can use them as sources of information. If your friends start to tell you that your baby daddy has been asking them about you, this is a clear sign that he wants you back, but he cannot admit it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b99bc86ae50dc36.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sad quotes about crushes on a guy</span></p></a><h3>8. He shows signs of improvement</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg><p class=align-left>If you broke up with your baby daddy because of specific issues, he might consider giving up on his old ways. When he comes over to see his kid or whenever you meet, he will try to show you that he has given up on the habits.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, if you broke up because of bad money spending habits, you will notice, or he will tell you that he is managing his funds wisely. If you broke up because of excessive alcohol consumption, he would try to cut it. He is probably assuming that you will get back together by behaving the way you have wanted him to.</p><h3>9. He is always staring at you</h3><p class=align-left>Another sign that he still wants you back in his life is him staring at you. Catching him staring at you one or two times is understandable. But three or more times means something else.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><h3>10. He is always talking about the breakup</h3><p class=align-left>Everyone wants to know why their partners broke up with them. After all, if you don't understand why your lover left you, how can you learn how to avoid such situations in future affairs? If your baby daddy is reaching out to talk about why you broke up, it means he is trying to understand the reason you walked away.</p><p class=align-left>He could be trying to know where things went wrong to fix them. He could also be making sure if you happen to get back together, he won’t repeat the same mistake. It is a good sign that he wants you back if he always insists on knowing why you walked away and why you cannot forgive him.</p><p class=align-left>The above are some of the surest signs your baby daddy wants you back but is scared to admit it. Once you spot any of the signs, make sure you don’t abuse the situation and drag your kid into the breakup by guilt-tripping, forcing, or manipulating your baby daddy. If you want him back, too, you could give him signs or talk over the issue the next time he comes to visit his kid.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54c257078ed60f4f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to tell if your baby mama still loves you</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> outlined 10 ways to know that <a href=#>she loves you</a> in a distance relationship. Love is something that is not easy to sustain, especially if it is not true. It can be tricky if people are not living close to each other.</p><p class=align-left>A man and a woman need trust and love to stay together. This has to be present in even higher amounts when the distance is involved. It is important, therefore, to have the confidence that a woman still loves you even when you are not near her.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAkGttbW9dZn1uv8igpaxlkpavunnDmpudsV2osKK%2BxJ1ksqelY7W1ucs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

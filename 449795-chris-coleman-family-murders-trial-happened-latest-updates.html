He was born to Christian parents Ron and Connie Coleman. When he was still in high school, he signed up for the Marine Corp and entered the military right out of <a href=#>high school</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a1fb7d1b158574e0.jpg><p class=align-left>Joyce Meyer hired Chris to work in the <a href=#>security</a> team. He quickly rose through the ranks, and he became her personal bodyguard.</p><h2>Who was Chris Coleman married to?</h2><p class=align-left>Chris was married to Sheri Coleman. The duo met in May 1997 at a K-9 training seminar at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. Chris and Sheri dated for a few months before getting married. Their marriage was full of ups and downs as they disagreed on many things. Her job as the personal bodyguard of Joyce Meyer means that he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was rarely at home</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/850791058ea90092.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Karla Brown story: What happened and the latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They were blessed with two children, Gavin Coleman and Garret Coleman.

Chris had left home early that morning for his morning workout. He made several calls and texted Sheri several times, but he did not get any response.</p><p class=align-left>Chris called his neighbour and asked him to check on Sheri and the kids. When the police arrived at the crime scene, he narrated the story to them. The police investigators suspected that Chris could have a hand in the homicide. So they took him to the police headquarters for interrogation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9873971d1ad17dc7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jesse L.

The detectives found enough evidence to prove that Coleman killed his family before leaving the house that morning.</p><p class=align-left>However, he maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty. His trial began on April 25, 2011, in Waterloo, Illinois. He was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder. Prosecutors painted a picture of a desperate man who wanted to get out of the <a href=#>marriage </a>and build a new life with Tara.</p><p class=align-left>Coleman pinned the murders on a mystery assailant who had been sending threatening emails to him, but a computer forensic analyst discovered that the emails were sent from Coleman's laptop. After analyzing the evidence and testimonies from key witnesses such as Tara and Joyce Meyer, the jurists delivered the verdict that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Coleman was guilty </a>of the three counts of murder.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44a1c83012c4c607.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Percy Gibson: Net worth, nationality, career, wedding, family</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Chris was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

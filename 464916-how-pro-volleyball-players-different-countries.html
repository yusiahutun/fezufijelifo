These factors include the foreigner's league quota, skill level, and position. So, how do these factors affect the player’s earnings and endorsements?</p><h3>Foreigner quota</h3><p class=align-left>The foreigner quota is one of the most integral factors regarding a professional player's earnings. Every volleyball league has rules specifying the number of foreigners that can play on contract for a club. Of course, the lower the number of foreigners in a club, the higher their salaries.</p><p class=align-left>Foreign players in Russia and Poland make more money than other countries. The primary reason is that the foreigner quota for the two countries is low, with 2 players for Russia and 3 for Poland.</p><p class=align-left>Other countries like Germany don't have a foreigner quota. For example, France only allows 6 per team, while Italy allows only 4.</p><h3>The skill level</h3><p class=align-left>You will be in high demand if you are highly skilled, and teams would want to pay more for you to join them. Therefore, you will be able to determine how much money your contract will be worth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e9327780831b79da.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How much do NBA referees make?

Therefore, Tier 1 leagues have the highest competition and here’s where you will find the best players, earning lucrative amounts.</p><h3>Volleyball position</h3><p class=align-left>Like other sports, your position greatly influences how the game turns out, and if you hold a critical one (likely the scorer), you will be more valuable and earn more. Some positions are harder to find talent for than others, making the players sought-after.</p><p class=align-left>In volleyball, outside and opposite hitters earn a massive amount. Every team is interested in signing big-time scorers, and outside and opposite hitters provide the ultimate solution.</p><h2>Pro volleyballers' salaries in different countries</h2><p class=align-left>As expected, professional volleyballers earn differently in various countries, considering the factors involved. For example, some countries have a lower foreigner quota while others have a high one.

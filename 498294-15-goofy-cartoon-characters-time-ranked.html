For example, in the animated <a href=#>series</a><i> The Simpsons</i>, each character has a unique physical appearance with exaggerated features, such as Bart's spiky hair or Marge's towering beehive hairstyle.</p><p class=align-left>The goofy style is not limited to American cartoons but also Japanese anime, whereby characters have large, expressive eyes and exaggerated facial expressions to convey emotion and mood. But who are some of the most popular goofy cartoon characters of all time?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7107500456ca37cf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 15 best cartoon trios who worked perfectly together</span></p></a><h2>15 goofy-looking cartoon characters</h2><p class=align-left>Chances are always high that any cartoon you watch will have funny-shaped cartoon characters. Those characters also turn out to be the most famous and memorable. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pon Bey</a> ere are 15 goofy cartoon characters of all time.</p><h3>1. Bugs Bunny</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7107500456ca37cf.jpeg><p class=align-left>Bugs Bunny's design and appearance have evolved and often varied depending on the animator and animation studio responsible for creating the cartoons. Nevertheless, his appeal and signature characteristics, such as his quick wit, cleverness, and often irreverent humour, have made him a beloved and enduring character in American popular culture.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the earlier iterations of his design in the 1930s and 1940s were based on the physical characteristics of hares and rabbits, which might have contributed to his goofy look. However, his current design and appearance have become more refined and recognisable.</p><h3>2. CatDog</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b3f64cf935ed397c.jpg><p class=align-left>CatDog ranks among the top list of funny-looking cartoon characters. He has an unusual and unconventional design because the animators saw it fit to conjoin a Cat and Dog and give it an animated series. Also, its goofy appearance is deliberate because the show features the character’s comic misadventures. That suggests CatDog’s appearance is used for humour and entertainment.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0d76e1f6d83ae04e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best fat cartoon characters that you'll love watching</span></p></a><h3>3.

The <a href=#>cartoon character </a>is portrayed as an excitable, young cat-bear-rabbit thingy with large eyes and a squishy, round body.</p><p class=align-left>The design exaggerates his childlike qualities, making him more relatable and appealing to the show's target audience. Chowder may have a chubby body because he serves as an apprentice under the chef Mung Daal and lives in a room at the top of a catering business.</p><h3>4. Daffy Duck</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8e137381f3f36e62.jpg><p class=align-left>Daffy Duck is one of the cartoon characters with goofy personalities from Looney Tunes.

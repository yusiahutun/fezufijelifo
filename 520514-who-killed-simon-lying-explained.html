Interestingly, the show has an even darker adaptation of his death than the book. The four classmates became the prime suspects during the investigation. The other students at their <a href=#>high school </a>even nicknamed them with ominous names like "The Bayview Four" and "Murder Club".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44131473d84b5275.jpg><p class=align-left>So, who was the killer in <i>One of Us is Lying</i>? It is revealed that Simon tainted his own water with peanut oil in a sick prank he planned with Jake. It was all meant to be a harmless but ruthless prank.</p><p class=align-left>Did Simon kill himself in <i>One of Us Is Lying</i>?

The nurse's office revealed a record of Simon bringing more EpiPens into school. He did so to ensure someone could save him if he experienced an anaphylactic reaction.</p><h2>How did Jake kill Simon in One of Us Is Lying</h2><p class=align-left>The blame lies squarely on Jake. He had helped Simon come up with the plan through their Xbox gaming chats. He was supposed to be waiting outside the library with an EpiPen in hand.

Therefore, he removed all the EpiPens from the nurse's office to avoid being linked to the prank.

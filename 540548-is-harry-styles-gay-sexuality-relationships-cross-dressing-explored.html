That is why some people think he is gay.</p><p class=align-left>Over the years, Harry has sent mixed signals about his sexuality. For instance, in an interview with British GQ magazine’s September 2013 issue, Harry stated that he was “pretty sure” he didn’t identify as bisexual.</p><p class=align-left>Later, in 2014, Harry commented that he was interested in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating someone</a> and being female was “not that important”. Then came 2017, and the talented singer stated he “never felt the need to label his sexuality”.</p><p class=align-left>In 2018, Harry Styles released a track called <i>Medicine </i>that fans labelled as a bisexual theme.

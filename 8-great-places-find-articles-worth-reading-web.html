But there is also a fair amount of clickbait rubbish. How do you find the content that is worth reading while avoiding all the low-effort articles?</p><p>Here are some of the best places on the web to find thoughtful and engaging articles.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=longform>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Longform</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/longform.png><p>Longform is an article curation service. It recommends both new and classic non-fiction articles from a variety of different online sources.</p><p>It encourages submissions from its engaged community of readers, thus giving rise to a diverse and delightful selection of articles that are suggested on any given day. Furthermore, it also accepts readers' own work, though the work has to pass through a strict editorial filter before it is recommended on the site.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The core focus of the Longform site is non-fiction, though a spinoff fiction service launched in 2012 has become perennially popular.</p><p>Sections on the site include Arts, Business, Crime, History, Politics, Science, Sex, Sports, Tech, and World. Make sure you also check out the “Best Of” annual archive for a rich trove of suggestions from bygone years.</p><h2 id=longreads>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Longreads</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/longreads.png><p>Another of the most popular article curation sites is Long reads. It is a direct competitor of Longform. The site is dedicated to “helping people find and share the best storytelling in the world”.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>There are 11 categories for you to dig into. They are Crime Reporting, Business Writing, Food, Music Writing, Sports and Games, Writing on COVID-19, Science and Nature, Arts and Culture, Profiles, Essays, and Investigative Reporting.</p><p>The site also produces its own stories (often revolving around gun violence, genocide, and environmental destruction), with the work funded by its membership pass. The membership costs $5/month, $50/year, or $100 for a lifetime pass.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>And in case you still doubt the quality of the work on Longreads, be aware that it has been nominated for four National Magazine Awards and has been highlighted as a quality source by both the Online News Association and the Peabody Awards.</p><h2 id=the-browser>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Browser</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/the-browser.png><p>The Browser sifts through hundreds of articles every day to bring you the finest content from across the web in the form of a newsletter.

But as any Reddit user will know, there is also an enormous number of poor submissions that you should not waste your time with.</p><p>If you are specifically interested in long-form journalism, you should subscribe to the r/InDepthStories Subreddit. It started life as a forum for investigative journalism, but has since grown to become a repo of all forms of high-quality long-form content.</p><p>Standards are kept high by the Subreddits mods, who rule with an iron fist. Anything that is not considered long-form will be removed, and they also do not allow political long-form articles. The ban on political content might seem Draconian, but it is done to keep the community civilized and make sure the comments on each article remain focused and thoughtful.</p><h2 id=pocket>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pocket</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pocket.png><p>Pocket is best known as a read-it-later bookmarking service.

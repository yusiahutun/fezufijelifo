You're all so beautiful," Ruth asked.</p><p>"You fight it everyday," Dorinda quipped, with panel moderator and self-proclaimed Bravo lover, Michael Rappaport adding, "You look beautiful, Ruth."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>One of my favorite moments from <a href=#>#BravoCon</a>: 84-year-old fan Ruth asks the OG <a href=#>#RHONY</a> ladies a question during their panel ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lpCNWp452z</a></p>‚Äî Gibson Johns (@gibsonoma) <a href=#>November 6, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@gibsonoma</a><p>Countless Luann, meanwhile, said the key to that youthful glow is "happiness."</p><p>The adorable appearance not only went viral, it earned Ruth an offer on the next RHONY girls trip, with Dorinda telling the superfan, "I think Ruth needs to join us on our next trip. Let's get Ruth in a Bikini."</p><p>"I'm ready," the 84-year-old quipped. "I have an American Express card. Will travel."</p><p>Ruth was such a hit, she ended up in the BravoCon press room, where she was surprised by network exec, Andy Cohen.</p><p>Later on in the weekend, Ruth -- a longtime Bravo fan who revealed she tuned into the network while her husband was sick -- attended a BravoCon Live taping, where she got a standing ovation from all 19 of the Bravolebrities in the building. She also appeared to score an invitation for the 2024 convention, as Andy made it a point to say he'd see her next year.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This woman Ruth stood up to ask a question at the <a href=#>#RHONYLegacy</a> panel, and said she was 84 years old, and a huge fan. Later, Bravo staffers found her and took her to the press room so <a href=#>@Andy</a> could surprise her. <a href=#>#BravoCon</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JIfIqsNn9g</a></p>‚Äî Kate Aurthur (@KateAurthur) <a href=#>November 6, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@KateAurthur</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>I talked to <a href=#>@andy</a> later, and he said Ruth told him that when her husband was sick and she was his caretaker, she watched Bravo shows to make herself feel better. (I was crying watching this, in case you wondered.)</p>‚Äî Kate Aurthur (@KateAurthur) <a href=#>November 6, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@KateAurthur</a><p>BravoCon wasn't just a jam-packed weekend for Ruth, but for the the RHONY legacy cast too, who not only helmed panels and took pictures with fans throughout the weekend at the Las Vegas convention, but also <a href=#><strong>debuted the trailer</strong></a> for their highly anticipated spin-off series, Ultimate Girls Trip: RHONY Legacy.</p><p>In addition to Luann, Sonja and Dorinda, Kelly Killoren Bensimon and Kristen Taekman were all on hand to promote the show. While <a href=#><strong>Ramona Singer</strong></a>, who was axed from attending the fan event <a href=#><strong>following allegations she made racist comments during her time on the network</strong></a>, she is on the show and was heavily featured in the video.</p><p>Her name also did not come up once during the panel.</p><p>The season finds the women going to St. Barts, returning to the same villa they stayed in on Season 5 of RHONY -- also known as The Pirate House. According to Lu, while the pirate himself doesn't appear on the show in person, the trip will feature a phone call from him.</p><p>The footage also teases some confrontations between Kelly and Lu, and Dorinda and Kristen, with Kirsten facing questions abut her husband's Ashley Madison scandal.</p><p>Fans can also expect some hot men, some topless action from the women and at least one instance of Luann once again falling over.</p><p>During the panel for the series, Sonja revealed she's been dating "a Viking" for a few months now -- quipping she asked him "Did you always have a beard?" because they always do it "doggy style." She later added she's been "getting it good" as the women gave updates on their love lives.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a73098b5-d624-4d11-8901-ed5de94f5336 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4f1db02c-eb1e-48b8-9436-f264452e7c95 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f6/5by4/2023/11/05/f6b732867a524e38bf5b3524aa8e3f9d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kristen Taekman Had to Hash Things Out with One Costar Before Filming Ultimate Girls Trip: RHONY Legacy</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Dorinda, meanwhile, praised Kristen for coming "after me" during filming, before all the women revealed they were NOT invited to former costar Tinsley Mortimer's upcoming wedding. Lu also shared she had been "flirting away" with Captain Jason from Below Deck Down Under all weekend at BravoCon.</p><p>The otherwise celebratory mood in the convention hall became briefly awkward when one fan brought up Bethenny Frankel's "takedown" of Bravo. Rapaport quickly shut it down -- insinuating the full event was a sign it wasn't working -- and saved the women from having to address it. Kelly, however, claimed Bethenny recently reached out to her about appearing on her podcast. Kelly's response: "I'll revisit it in 2025."</p><p>The show debuts Thursday, December 14 with three episodes, before new ones drop weekly.</p><a id=gallery-link-73945b91-7afe-475c-8e39-4cc213d89c81 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:73945b91-7afe-475c-8e39-4cc213d89c81 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:4f1db02c-eb1e-48b8-9436-f264452e7c95 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e8/4by3/2023/11/04/e863ab687a314901b2f338e1f8002189_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaW5fbYFuxcSaqWannJl6s7TOp7Bmq6WlsrOywKdkrKyVlrm0edOhnGarmKTEbrDUq6Cnn12Xv6LCzpymp2WglrumuI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

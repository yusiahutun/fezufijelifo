"He'd cheated on me before with one person, an actress, (our sources tell us the sultry Meagan Goode) but he told me that he loved me and she "seduced" him into it.", said Bailon recognizably holding back tears. The two had been dating for nine months and James reportedly bought her a $150,000 platnium and diamond ring which she sports on her ring finger. " I just cant believe he cheated on me so many times with so many people", she continued. " I was loyal to him throughout our entire relationship, and thats the thanks I deserve, that's ****". Adrienne found out about Lebrons unfaithful liaison when he came home with the stench of another woman's "nether region". "I found out on Valentines Day of all the days in the year Valentines day. I smelled it, and he couldn't even look me in the eye and tell me I was wrong. However,I wish him well in the future, because he'll never find someone who loved him like I did".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZomJ2qmZq7r7GMm5iipJ%2BjeqK6w2ajnpqipLtutsCmnKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

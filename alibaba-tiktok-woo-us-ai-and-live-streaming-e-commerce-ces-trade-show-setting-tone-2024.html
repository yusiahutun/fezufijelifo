No tech giant’s exhibition was complete without showing off its effort in that space.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By putting generative AI at the centre of its exhibition, Alibaba.com made it clear where it thought the platform’s advantage lies, despite some grumblings from a marketing manager that the product was not quite yet ready for prime time, according to a brand ambassador at the booth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A number of CES attendees at the Alibaba.com presentation were made up of select “gold suppliers”, or those that pay for a premium membership on the platform, according to some exhibitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A test of Smart Assistant by the Post showed the all-too-common limitations of new LLM-powered chatbots. When asked about the best options for sourcing a 10,000-milliampere-hour power bank, it offered a link to search results for the product on Alibaba.com. A follow-up query on the best way to determine differences in quality among suppliers resulted in a generic response about checking certifications and standards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/15/b4f2b04e-92e3-4588-8f81-51fac86ad8ed_ab01d493.jpg><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">ByteDance</span></a>-owned TikTok, already famous for its more traditional recommendation algorithms that have made its short video service so difficult to put down, went in a different direction at CES. Its TikTok Shop booth inside the Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, was set up with a live-streaming area where some influencers were invited to sell their wares directly from the trade show.While TikTok remains best known outside China as a platform to consume bite-sized videos, live-streaming e-commerce is already big business for the app’s Chinese version, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Douyin</span></a>. E-commerce is seen by Beijing-based parent ByteDance as an important area for future growth.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">TikTok Shop representatives were roaming the CES floor looking for companies they can convince to sell on the platform. That task may have been harder for the US team. A US-based TikTok Shop employee told Shenzhen-based mechanical keyboard maker Keychron that he was not allowed to sign up Chinese companies. Only their team in mainland China can on-board those suppliers.</p>Connections with mainland Chinese suppliers are seen as the secret weapon for new e-commerce entrants like <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Shein</span></a> and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">PDD Holdings</span></a>’ <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Temu</span></a>. These platforms are taking on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Amazon.com</span></a> on its home turf with dirt-cheap products, which are sold as they roll off the factory floor from their mainland suppliers.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Tech giants Alibaba, ByteDance lead China’s return to CES</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Temu or Shein can get those very low-cost items and low-cost shipping because they have the volume,” said Stanley Wong, co-founder and chief product officer of Hong Kong-based Spaceship, which exhibited at CES under its Taiwanese entity. “They have very professional teams to do that kind of supply chain management.”</p>TikTok Shop is also seeking to take on Shein and Temu. TikTok sees international e-commerce expansion so important to its future that it <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">bought a 75 per cent stake</span></a> in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Indonesia</span></a>’s largest online shopping platform, enabling the firm restart its local operations which had earlier been suspended by regulators in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese suppliers are also Alibaba.com’s bread and butter. While it is ostensibly a global sourcing platform, the vast majority of companies on Alibaba.com are Chinese, which typically offer big cost advantages owing to the mainland’s vast manufacturing supply chain.</p>Even <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">start-ups</span></a> are trying to use AI to help companies navigate the changing landscape of e-commerce in the West. Spaceship, for example, uses AI to help brands manage their own shops with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify</span></a> to determine the best logistics options for goods manufactured in China.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Alibaba pushes new AI tool to help wholesale merchants manage overseas clients</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our focus is to enable individual sellers to” achieve cost-effective supply chain management like Shein and Temu, Spaceship’s Wong said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As more merchants try to control their own brands and reduce the money they lose to platforms like Shein, Temu and TikTok Shop by operating their own sites, services like Spaceship make sense when making price comparisons on logistics solutions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, Spaceship does not have its own generative AI product yet to take on the likes of Alibaba. The company said it is considering one for customer service.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many of the underpinnings of AI LLMs are open-source code, making the technology easily accessible to start-ups even if they do not have the data advantage of tech giants. But it could be some time before the kinks are worked out and these start-ups can handle more sophisticated requirements of business users.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2iZop9dqbKktI6aqa2hk6GycH%2BRbW9tbmlkrq21wZqZmmWknri1u8pmrqinXarAbq3IZpinnF2htrexjKyrq52Roravs4yeZJynnaKys6%2FEZpqeq12pv6KwxGaqoaenYsCmwNOipaBlpKS7pnmRaWlt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

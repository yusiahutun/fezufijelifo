Appearing on <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">White Wine Question Time with Kate Thornton</a>, the former Family Fortunes star recalled the moment he first saw Chris.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoo7VrCcqNX data-wc=41>"I tell this story in my book that when Mike became my manager in 1973 and Lynne and I were about to get married – my first wife, Lynne – we were excited that Mike had become my manager," Les said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d3e4da923b3d-amanda-holden-les-dennis-wedding.jpg><p id=eC_gqjyWl8 data-wc=44>"She said, 'Let's drive past his house' because he lived on Queens Drive in Liverpool, we passed, and the curtains were open, and I went, 'Look, there he is', and we saw Mike Hughes picking up a little child and swinging the child around."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ew5Hw825NT data-wc=82>Les added: "Lynne, later, after a lot of things had happened in my life said to me, 'Just think, if we'd known then, had somebody tapped on our shoulders as we were sat in the front of the car and said to us then that you two are going to marry next year, but your marriage won't last, and you <strong>Les will marry a younger woman who will one day then marry the child that is being swung around in that room.'"</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/137ce740ef77-les-dennis-wife-claire-nicholson.jpg><p id=eFPhiQ1oAjK data-wc=68>Les was married to his first wife, Lynn Webster, for 16 years and they welcomed a son, Phillip, now 43, before they split in 1990.

In June, the former Coronation Street&nbsp;star revealed he has forgiven her for having an affair during their marriage. "Amanda was in the papers recently, saying some nice things about me. That was very kind of her," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Times.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0b96b1c2b260-amanda-holden-chris-hughes.jpg><p id=eGwO7sWEQ23 data-wc=49>"Maybe with time, she has been able to look back and see things differently. We're not in touch but I am happy that she's happy." He added: <strong>"I can watch Britain's Got Talent without getting angry. To be honest, it's like watching a different person, someone I've never met."</strong></p><p id=epG1cT3dlGM data-wc=57>Meanwhile, he also revealed during his podcast appearance that if anyone was going to play Amanda in a film about his life, it would be her. He explained: "Well, I suppose Amanda would have to be there. It's a chapter in my life that was huge, and I have no idea who to cast in that role."&nbsp;</p><p id=e5q-ulMdUE data-wc=17>When Kate suggested that "Amanda could probably pull that one off herself", he replied: "Maybe, maybe yes."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZm1xZ219d3vAppinnJFitbC4w56lZp2oYrW2v8GapZ1lnJrAbrDEp6Wiq12owrO80aKqoqaXYrCwus2emq2hn6N6tLHCqKWdZZiqwKOtzZ1knKCinsButNSgn56rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

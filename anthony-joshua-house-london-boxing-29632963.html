I’ve been working with DAZN and following its progress for a long time. We have enjoyed a really successful partnership in the US for many years and I know the team and understand the passion and drive of the business.”</p><p>The growing sports streaming platform showed AJ’s vital win as he prevailed via unanimous decision on his return to the O2 Arena.

He said: "You know me, I like to provide for the fans. I know who the fans want. Who do the fans want?</p><p>"They said Fury? The ball is in his court, I will 100 per cent be honoured to compete for the WBC heavyweight championship of the world.

I am convinced that without the leadership of this community and the relationships that exist with many of our partners involved in this project, it simply would not have been possible.”</p><p>Like the spirit of the hit HGTV show “Home Town,” when the project was first pitched, many believed it would be an impossibility to reclaim the former grandeur of the structure.</p><p>“Many contractors or architects wouldn’t care about all the history and the lives that lived in these homes,” Laurel Mayor Johnny Magee said. “They would have just leveled it all to the ground and started over with new construction, but our past —our struggles and triumphs — are always celebrated in Laurel. I am so glad that the perfect group of individuals were gathered to create this project that honors our past and shines a light on our future.”</p><p>Renowned local architect Michael McKinnon, who appeared on “Home Town” and had a downtown apartment beautifully redone, found that almost the entire framework of the building was still intact 85 years after its construction. His and organizers’ goals were to keep as much of the original structure and its historical significance while designing a modern visitors’ center.</p><p>“We wanted there to be lots of light flowing through the building to represent the progress and promise that this building represents,” McKinnon said. “It was a meticulous job, but we kept the original framework so that visitors could see how the building was laid out.”</p><p>One of the gems of the city is a re-creation of one of the apartments as it was in the 1940s. The Economic Development Authority of Jones County collected donations of furniture and fixtures to make the room true to the time period.</p><p>“We wanted to give everyone a glimpse of the past as one of the apartments is completely furnished in 1940s fashion,” McKinnon said. “… We wanted to acknowledge the fact that this housing complex served as a portal for a lot of families that entered Laurel during that time, and now we want to turn this portal into an opportunity to present our history to the tourism context because this is on the Register Historical Buildings”</p><p>The small apartment is definitely a trip back in time, as the gleaming wooden floors and small but efficient appliances shine. The rooms are small but homey with two beds for little ones with dolls and books to occupy their time. The living room and eating area have a simple but elegant design. It’s an amazing feeling to think that you are actually standing in the footsteps of the founders and citizens of our community.</p><p>“We wanted to lean heavily on the history of this building and area and also create a beautiful building with gorgeous landscaping to enjoy,” McKinnon said. “Your first introduction to the building is to the openness of the structure and the beautiful light that streams through the 56 windows in the building. It gives it an awe-inspiring, ethereal experience.”</p><p>Inside are photographs and biographies of some of our most famous Laurel residents, including internationally acclaimed opera singer Leontyne Price, Olympic champion Ralph Boston, ’NSync member Lance Bass, and Ben and Erin Napier of “Home Town.”</p><p>The exterior features a mosaic by Chicago artist Carolyn Elaine that portrays important time stamps in Laurel’s history.</p><p>“It is truly exquisite,” said George Bassi, director of the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art. “Carolyn Elaine came in 2022 and worked with residents of the Laurel Housing Authority who helped design it. They created the content of it, and they came and helped her execute this design. She’s been terrific to work with. She was unable to be with us today, but she’ll be on one of the episodes of ‘Home Town’ next spring talking about the mural.”</p><p>A sculpture by Oxford artist Earl Dismuke is on loan for five years. “It’s just wonderful,” Bassi said. “He is one of Mississippi’s most prolific public sculpture artists that we have, and we’re really glad to work with him to be able to have a piece of his art on loan for here a bit.”</p><p>While the center pays homage to the city’s past, it also features many modern amenities, including RV parking spaces and plans are in the works for electric car-charging stations. A dog park sits adjacent to the center and features billboard-style paintings on the wall of the park fence done by artist Will Sellers.</p><p>“These are all efforts that we should be proud of due to the strong culmination of planning, work and cooperation,” Magee said. “Through the generous donation of so many individuals and organizations and the hard work of so many people, we welcome you to visit this fine facility. This is truly a living legacy.”</p><p>The center was partially paid for through a 3 percent tourism tax on hotels and short-term rentals, in addition to private donations.</p><p>“Today, we get to celebrate an achievement of a belief that started two years ago,” said Ross Tucker, president of the EDA, “and now we are here to celebrate the beginning.”</p><p dir=ltr><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcK2MpaCvoZ6ceq2xxpqasmeRp8Gqr8uelmpqk2Wxd3yTZm9snmdifnKxxGZwnZ5lYrF0hMSamp1rlZiGpXrHraSl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

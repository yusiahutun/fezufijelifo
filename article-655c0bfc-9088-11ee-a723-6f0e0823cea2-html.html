But with the arrival of colder weather, that means an increase in the number of house fires.</p><p>On Thursday, Jones County volunteers responded to two fires that caused catastrophic damage to homes.</p><p>Just after 5 a.m., Shady Grove volunteers responded to 408 Highway 15 in Jasper County to render mutual aid to firefighters with several Jasper County volunteer departments at a single-family brick home. It was engulfed in flames when the first volunteers arrived and it was gutted by the blaze.</p><p>No injuries were reported by the department. The recently remodeled home of David and Julie Franks was reportedly a total loss and a GoFundMe account has been set up for them. Mossville volunteers responded along with volunteers from Stringer and Bay Springs.</p><p>Then, a few hours later at 9:15, volunteers from Glade, Ovett, South Jones, Powers, M&M and Johnson responded to a fire at 1242 Old Highway 15 Road and saw smoke billowing from the single-wide mobile home and flames throughout the home.</p><p>No injuries were reported to humans, but the family did lose their dog and cat in the blaze. The mobile home sustained severe damage.</p><p>Jones County Fire Council members thanked deputies from the Jones County Sheriff’s Department for their response and assistance at the latter call. Several helped firefighters, which was greatly needed at that time, council spokeswoman Dana Bumgardner said.</p><p>“Jones County first-responders continue to show an excellent team mentality and wonderful cooperation,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcLzErapmqJWntrS0jKKlZquVmLyvsIyhpq6rlWKzqr7EZqCnZZakwrN5x6isq6tflr%2B1tcKlnJhuZWqwca7FnGRyaGhtenJ9xJ5kmm9iaHp3so%2BeZ3FqY5iyon6NoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

I told [Fat] Joe, ‘Joe, why you ain’t tell me he was [going to be there]?’ He’s like, ‘I know. It’s terrible… I couldn’t risk you…’ He’s like, ‘I couldn’t risk you not coming if you knew he was going to be there.’ I said, ‘Joe…'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ashanti added that the reunion was “very unexpected. I hadn’t seen him in like 6 years or more, spoken or seen, so it was a little awkward.” Nelly and Ashanti <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>did hug on stage</a> at one point. When host <strong>Angie Martinez</strong> brought up Fat Joe asking if there was a chance of a rekindling between Ashanti and Nelly, Ashanti stressed that the answer to that is “no.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ashanti-nelly-ex-six-years-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>But Fat Joe isn’t giving up hope. He commented on the clip that Power 105.1 posted, “Never give up on love.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ashanti and Nelly began dating in 2003 and became one of hip hop’s biggest power couples. They were in a relationship for 11 years until 2014. It ultimately came down to trust between the couple, and Ashanti opened up about their split in 2015.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I think sometimes when people have their own insecurities, it allows them to act out of character,” Ashanti said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Meredith Vieira Show</a>. “I’ve been betrayed. You just have to grow. You have to grow up. You have to accept responsibility for the things that you do. I’m not a big fan of people being cowards.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ashanti-nelly-ex-six-years-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Ashanti previously talked about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seeing her ex again</a> at the Verzuz Battle on The Tamron Hall Show. “When I saw him kind of coming across the stage, I was just like, ‘Oh…’ and it was so weird because we haven’t seen or spoken to each other for over six years… so it was a weird feeling,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5BvZpqrmJa7tbWMq5yuppmptq%2BzjKecpaSpYsOmvtmusWaakanBrbGMr6CdnZ9k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Hampton said police did not suspect foul play at this point.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>The man fell close to the area where players’ wives and families sit. Stadium medical personnel treated him for about 10 minutes, applying CPR. As they worked in a circle around the man, security officers cleared the area. The fan was taken from the seating area on a backboard.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>After Saturday night’s fall, some fans in the family section were escorted to a room near the Braves’ clubhouse, and many were upset. Braves outfielder Cameron Maybin’s son was crying. A woman went to the Braves dugout and told catcher AJ Pierzynski about what had occurred.</p><figure id=5f3508fe-f8d7-4f3c-ad28-834557e96f80 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Rescue workers carry the fan from the stands at Turner Field.</span> Photograph: John Bazemore/AP</figure><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>A security guard at the room where the family members went said witnesses saw the man trying to hang on to a wire that runs from the protective net behind the plate to under the media box. The man then fell the rest of the way on to the seats. Police blocked off about 10 rows of seats in section 201.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>On 12 August 2013, a fan died at Turner Field after falling 26 metres (85ft) from a walkway on the fourth level of the stadium. Investigators from the Fulton county medical examiner’s office later ruled the death of Ronald Lee Homer Jr, 30, was a suicide.</p><figure id=8bb96d69-16cf-4df5-866e-3211e8222c4a data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>Fickle fortunes in Los Angeles as Dodgers and Angels fight twin slumpsRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Police said Homer, of Conyers, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Georgia</a>, landed in the players’ parking lot after a rain delay during a game between the Braves and Philadelphia.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Two fans died at major league games in 2011. In Texas, a man fell about six metres (20ft) to the ground beyond the outfield fence trying to catch a baseball tossed his way by Rangers outfielder Josh Hamilton. Shannon Stone – a 39-year-old firefighter from Brownwood, Texas – was attending the Rangers game with his young son.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Earlier that year, a 27-year-old man died after falling about six metres (20ft) and striking his head on concrete during a Colorado Rockies home game. Witnesses told police the man was trying to slide down a staircase railing at Coors Field and lost his balance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKugpL%2B1e5FpaG5nkaq0cH%2BPaJmaq5WXrq24jJ%2BYp2WUnrK0ecCfq56qXZuurbjIp55mnqKkum7Bz6mcq2WUmrCsecCtZK2toqOys3nFopylnF2ZwrO1zaBkm6qRq7K0ecaapJ4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

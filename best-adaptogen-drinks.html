They have botanical ingredients like elderberry or mushrooms that pop up on the label and tout the ability to calm, energize or help you focus. Don’t worry—Pepsi and Coke aren’t rebranding. These cans are all <a href=# id=auto-tag_adaptogen-drinks data-tag=adaptogen-drinks>adaptogen drinks</a>, a popular health-nut approved type of fizzy beverages that are jam-packed with herbs and developed in the hopes that they’ll make your body and mind feel calm.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>These ingredients have been used in Chinese medicine for centuries, but the term “adaptogen” wasn’t introduced to the science world until the 1940s thanks to a scientist from the USSR. For something to be considered an adaptogen <a href=# rel=nofollow>it must meet three criteria</a>: It has to help the body fight off physical or mental stress, it has to have the ability to bring your body back to homeostasis (calm) and it can’t cause any harm to the body’s normal functions.</p><p>How do adaptogens work? Well, <a href=# rel=nofollow>according to Healthline</a>, these herbs essentially “hack” your body’s stress response and stabilize your hypothalamic, pituitary and adrenal glands. Basically, if you’re in fight of flight mode, sipping on this remedy can bring you back to your normal, non-stressed mode.</p><p>Along with this de-stressing ability, adaptogens have also been found to have anti-fatigue and anti-depressive effects. They can also help stimulate your central nervous system, so those focus claims could be more accurate than you think.</p><p>Now, there isn’t a ton of data out there on adaptogen drinks, but a <a href=# rel=nofollow>2010 study</a> found that adaptogens also can help increase mental clarity, improve lung function and decrease symptoms of fatigue and exhaustion. A <a href=# rel=nofollow>2018 study</a> found that adaptogens can help close your adrenal gland to diminish the amount of stress hormones released when your body is feeling overwhelmed and can boost the production of cortisol to relieve stress and help with sleep.</p><p>And with Dry January trending and becoming a part of many’s 2023 resolutions, why not go for an adaptogenic drink instead of a glass of vino?</p><p>So, what are the best adaptogen drinks out there? There are a&nbsp;bunch&nbsp; to choose from, many of which have different purposes, flavors and ingredient lists. Whether you’re on the hunt for a non-acoholic drink or want to explore the world of adaptogens to help with stress, anxiety or sleep, you’ll be able to find a bevy that fits your needs.</p><p>We rounded up the best adaptogen drinks for stress, calmness, sleep and energy below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/laird-instant-latte.jpg><p>Laird Superfood offers a variety of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_stylecaster?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D87443X1593552%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3DSC--%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flairdsuperfood.com%252Fcollections%252Fall%252Fproducts%252Fsweet-and-creamy-instant-latte-with-adaptogens&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstylecaster.com%2Flifestyle%2Ffood-and-drink%2F1246950%2Fbest-adaptogen-drinks%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click">instant latte options</a> made with sweet and creamy superfood coconut milk creamer and freeze-dried premium coffee.

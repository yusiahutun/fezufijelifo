While research regarding the cause is inconclusive for this condition, there seems to be a genetic component. Thanks, Dad. Anyway, not only does the excess sweat impact my underarms, but it also takes its form on my palms and feet—embarrassing, I know. Anyway, my sad sob story aside, as you can imagine, I’ve experienced with a huge assortment of antiperspirants and deodorants over the course of my life, and through trial and error (along with a lot of stained white t-shirts and humiliating sweat rings) I’ve definitely found a few formulas that actually work to keep my <a href=# rel=noopener>sweating under control</a> (…most of the time, that is) and block odors.</p><p>When I was younger, I’d often apply my antiperspirant twice (sometimes three) times a day to keep the moisture at bay. While the jury is still out on the health risks antiperspirant may have, applying it three times a day certainly doesn’t seem like a good idea to me. This concern, however, did ultimately lead me to bask on my journey of finding a solid, clinical-strength product that actually helps to keep my underarms nice and dry for longer than just an hour or so.

Carpe Antiperspirant Lotion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/carpe-antiperspirant.jpg><p>Carpe’s extensive range of anti-sweat products is impressive. I’ve been using their amazing antiperspirant hand lotion for years. It truly comes in handy when I know I’ll be shaking hands with people at work. Their underarm antiperspirant comes in lotion form, making it easy to apply and allowing it to dry down almost instantly. Unlike other clinical-strength formulas, this one doesn’t irritate delicate underarm skin. I couldn’t live without this stuff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41tJart1x2L._SL500_.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$19.95</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$22.95</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>13% Off</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/secret-antiperspirant.jpg><p>Another clinical-strength formula, this quick-drying and odor-reducing formula keeps underarm perspiration at bay for up to 48 hours, and it smells amazing to boot. The soft solid formula is creamy in texture but dries down instantly for a comfortable, non-greasy feel. It’s also infused with skin-smoothing ingredients, so it’s a great option for those with sensitive skin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zZnGicFVL._SL500_.jpg><h2>3.

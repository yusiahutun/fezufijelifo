If you like to wear makeup, excess oil can result in unwanted shine and cause product to move around your face. That includes complexion products, like foundation, but with the right formula and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup tips for oily skin</a>, you can actually create a base that evens your skin tone and mattifies – without creasing, caking, smudging, or budging.</p><p>The best foundation products for oily skin types are not necessarily the same as what someone with a drier complexion would use. “People with oily skin can wear foundation, but it is especially important to choose foundation types that do not clog pores,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kristina Collins, MD</a>, double board certified dermatologist in Austin, TX. You’re going to want to look for formulas that are ‘non-comedogenic’ and ‘oil-free’ and perhaps even pull double duty as skincare thanks to extras like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>niacinamide</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>salicylic acid</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So, whether you are looking for a velvety matte complexion or want to maintain a bit of radiance (sans greasiness!), we’re rounding up the best foundations for oily skin.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-it-cosmetics-cc-cream-oil-free-matte-with-spf-40></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream Oil-Free Matte with SPF 40</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream Oil-Free Matte with SPF 40" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XDsUl3ZlfdIsRkXTgMi-8uD1ir4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/it-cosmetics-cc--cream-oil-free-matte-with-spf-40-a08860dae8964af7927ba4f0ba84beac.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This multitasking CC cream doubles as skincare and sun protection.<br><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It can be tricky to find the right shade.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are looking for a product that will complement your skincare, sun care, and makeup routines, look no further than a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>CC cream</a>. Based on your coverage desires, this pigmented cream from IT Cosmetics can be used as a mattifying moisturizer (thanks to hyaluronic acid, charcoal, Canadian colloidal clay, and Moroccan lava clay), skin-smoothing serum (hi, peptides, niacinamide, tea tree extract, and collagen), mineral sunscreen, concealer, and full-coverage matte foundation.</p><p>All of these added benefits are what makes it expert-approved. “I love it because it has skincare ingredients like hyaluronic acid, so I feel like I am getting full coverage without clogging my pores,” says Brittany Lo, a professional makeup artist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Beia</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Beautini</a>.

This one is lightweight, water-based, and easy to blend with a natural matte finish that won’t clog pores or exacerbate breakouts.

We’re here to tell you that it deserves another look – especially if you have oily skin. “It’s one of my top picks because it’s super clean, has buildable coverage, comes in a large range of colors, and is great for all skin types,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jessie Cheung, MD</a>, a board certified dermatologist in Chicago. Plus, it's a great option if you're prioritizing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>makeup products with SPF</a>. Because the mineral-based powder can be built from sheer to full coverage, you can use it as foundation, concealer, or setting powder and it is great for touch ups. “It immediately eradicates shine, and the powder formula feels very light and doesn’t clog pores,” Dr. Collins shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Coverage</strong>: Buildable | <strong>Shades</strong>: 30 | <strong>Type</strong>: Powder | <strong>Finish</strong>: Natural | <strong>Oil-Free</strong>: Yes | <strong>Size</strong>: 0.3 ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-full-coverage-make-up-for-ever-matte-velvet-skin-full-coverage-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Full Coverage</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Make Up For Ever Matte Velvet Skin Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Make Up For Ever Matte Velvet Skin Full Coverage Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/liukhbM0KJRguMtl-2zRsjJvbKM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/make-up-for-ever-matte-velvet-skin-full-coverage-foundation-6856a7ff4f954293ab54a18bd07bef4f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This velvety fluid feels really comfortable on the skin.<br><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> You’ll want to use a hydrating primer if you have any dry or flaky areas on your face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This velvety foundation will upend everything you think you know about matte, waterproof, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>full coverage foundations</a>.

As skin ages, there is more of a chance for uneven skin texture concerns (think: fine lines, wrinkles, crepiness), which matte finishes can draw attention to.

This longwear liquid is infused with hyaluronic acid to help lock moisture into the skin without weighing it down, so it will hydrate dry areas without making shiny spots, well, shinier.

Choosing a foundation that works with your skin instead of against it is a good first step, and formulas labeled ‘non-comedogenic’ and ‘oil-free’ should be at the top of your list. “‘Non-comedogenic’ means that the foundation will not contribute to clogged pores,” Dr. Collins explains. “People with oily skin have excess sebum production, which can lead to clogged pores and acne. Any product used on oily skin should not contribute to this process and, if anything, should help prevent excessive sebum, as well as keep pores clear.” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Foundation</a> is a great option that’s full coverage and non-comedogenic.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not all oils are comedogenic, but there are some – like coconut oil – that are. “Since oily skin already has excess oil in the pores, I recommend avoiding oil-containing foundations that can worsen the problem,” Dr. Kobets shares. Instead, “look for a water-based, matte-finish foundation that is oil controlling,” Dr. Koo notes.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Other Ingredients to Avoid<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But it goes beyond that. “While emollient ingredients – like dimethicone and oils – can feel dewy and are great for keeping skin hydrated by locking in moisture, they can also lock in excess oil and dirt in the pores,” Dr. Kobets says. As a result, you may want to patch test these formulas on your skin to see if any breakouts arise. “Silicone-based (containing dimethicone) foundations can come in matte forms and make pores appear smaller, just make sure you are checking the ingredients and product benefits,” she adds.</p><p>Our experts say people with oily skin may also want to steer clear of foundations with certain kinds of alcohol, isopropyl myristate, lanolin, mineral oil, paraffin, petrolatum, silicones, sodium chloride, synthetic fragrance, and wax, as they can all exacerbate sebum production, irritate the skin, and/or clog pores. Keep in mind, however, that product development has come a long way. “Don’t get too hung up on ingredients, as the silicones and alcohols in modern makeup formulations tend to be less oily or drying than older products,” Dr. Cheung says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients to Look For</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While those ingredients may be best avoided, there are plenty of actives that can benefit oilier complexions. “Silica powder, clay, charcoal, and salicylic acid will all help to absorb oil or decrease oil production,” Dr. Cheung notes. “Read the labels and look for a matte finish instead of a dewy or satin finish, which will add shine.” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">It Cosmetics CC+ Cream Oil-Free Matte </a>Foundation contains clay as well as is oil-free.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Texture<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Powder foundations</a> are ideal for oily skin because they usually have oil-absorbing properties, but liquid and cream foundations can all work just as well for oily skin. “Powder foundations are great for oily skin because they absorb some of the oiliness and help reduce shiny skin,” Dr. Saedi says.

One way to avoid this is to be less heavy handed with the application. “I don’t believe in a full face of foundation, as you really only need foundation where you need coverage,” Swift says. “Let your natural skin show wherever possible.” She recommends using a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>foundation brush</a> to apply product directly to blemishes and imperfections instead of piling on foundation. You can also apply foundation with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>makeup sponge</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“People with oily skin may need to be careful with thick, fuller coverage foundations that can clog pores or lead to acne breakouts,” Dr. Kobets explains. “Heavier foundations can make the skin more oily and lead to breakouts, clogged pores, and blackheads.” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Neutrogena Clear Coverage Flawless Matte CC Cream</a> is oil and fragrance free and has niacinamide to calm redness and breakouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What you ultimately choose should be reflective of your lifestyle. “I think the foundation type will depend most on the level of coverage they are looking for and possibly varies according to what type of event they are going to or what type of work and activities they do in their daily life,” Dr. Collins says.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Finish</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s the thing, there are no rules in makeup. If you have oily skin and want to lean into dewy skin, go for it. With that said, a lot of times the goal of wearing foundation when you have oily skin is to cut down on excess shine. That is usually best achieved with a matte finish. “Matte foundation can be a great option for oily skin because it will help absorb some of the oil and prevent looking shiny,” Lo says.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It all comes down to wearability. “Matte foundations just tend to look and wear better throughout the day for people with oily skin,” Gray explains. “Dewy foundations really just make dry skin look like oily skin. Oily skin already has built-in dew and radiance.”</p><p>“Radiant or dewy finishes can make the skin look shiny, but you can always set them with a matte finishing powder,” Lo notes. You can also mix and match. “A way to still use these is to use a mattifying foundation in your oily areas like the t-zone, and then you can add some of your radiant foundation above the cheek bones for a highlighting effect,” Scibelli says. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation</a> is a great pick if you’d like to maintain radiance without going full disco ball.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Should I wear foundation if I have oily skin?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether or not you wear complexion products is up to you, but there is no reason for people with oily skin to shy away from foundation – especially if you are looking to even out your skin tone. “People with oily skin can still have skin pigmentation or redness that they may want to cover up and that requires foundation,” Dr. Kobets explains. It’s all about choosing the right formula. “Oily skin and acne prone skin types need to use caution because certain formulas can cause skin clogging,” she cautions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If you have truly oily skin, most oil is going to break down any makeup on top of it.” This usually affects base makeup products like concealer, powder, and foundation, but it doesn’t have to. “I have learned that, if skin is properly prepped and we are using the right foundation for the skin type, we can avoid any oily makeup breakdown,” Gray says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is stick or liquid foundation better for oily skin?<strong><br></strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are times when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cream vs. liquid vs. powder foundations</a> should be used.

Both of these help control oil throughout the day because they tend to use less waxes and oils, which can help minimize excess sebum on the skin, Swift adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also be sure to avoid excess oils in the ingredients. “If the ingredient is at the top of the ingredient list that means it is present in higher concentrations,” Dr Korbet explained. For those reasons, she is a fan of light liquid and powder foundations for her patients with oily skin.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I make my foundation not slide around?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During your skincare and sun care application, Dr. Koo suggests using a hydrating toner or serum (she’s a fan of products with hyaluronic acid) to properly hydrate the complexion, which, in turn, will calm oil production. From there, you’ll want to start your makeup routine with a grippy base, such as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>primer made for oily skin</a>. “I recommend that oily skin types apply a mattifying primer to absorb excess oil and extend the wear of their foundation,” Dr. Cheung notes.</p><p>Next up: foundation. All of our experts recommend using a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>makeup brush</a> or sponge. “Oily skin does not have the same texture issues as people with dry skin tend to have, so you can really apply foundation by either brush or sponge,” Gray shares. “I would shy away from using my fingers, as that may add more oil to the skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For additional protection against shine and migration, a setting powder and spray can help keep everything in place. “Apply powder just in the t-zone,” Swift explains. “A little bit of glow on the skin goes a long way for reflecting light and making the skin look beautiful, so you never want to be totally matted down.”</p><p>Last but not least, it’s all about the spritz. “If you have oily skin, mists help set foundation nicely and can even give you a subtle glow without looking shiny,” Lo notes. “Plus, it will keep your makeup in place all day and night.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Meg Storm</a> is a freelance writer and editor with nearly a decade of experience covering the beauty industry.

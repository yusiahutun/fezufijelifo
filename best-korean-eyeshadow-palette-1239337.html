From its texture and finish to pigmentation, there are many factors to consider. Once you have downsized your theme for colors and shades, check for the type of finishes offered in a palette. The more the better! If you have a combination of mattes, glitters, metallics, and shimmers, you can create every look to wear from AM to PM. Pick a soft yet pigmented texture that is easy to blend and build, and additionally has a long stay.</p><p>Talking about the formula and finish, our contributor Maya Adivi, a certified makeup artist, says, “I think Korean powder eyeshadows are far more common and often have better wear times so they're worth the effort to master.”&nbsp;</p><p>She adds, “As far as ingredients are concerned, Korean eyeshadows are often quite gentle on sensitive eyes. You might want to avoid fragranced formulas or eyeshadows that contain crimson red or carmine pigment, as those can be allergenic.”</p><p><strong>Pigment: </strong>An essential thing to note for Korean palettes is that the shadows are only mid-pigmented.

You may also look for options that are water and sweat-proof, non-clumpy, and crease-proof. For an added benefit, go for the palettes that offer a dual-end brush so you can easily carry it and apply the makeup with ease.&nbsp;</p><p>Using a Korean eyeshadow palette is best for creating K-beauty-inspired looks.

After all, it’s our number one defense against cancer (not to mention a slew of superficial hazards, like fine lines and wrinkles). To make a long story short, applying face sunscreen should be a nonnegotiable step in every skincare routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But why not give yourself a little sun-protection superboost? It’s not all that hard to do given the recent influx in high-performance makeup products that feature SPF (and all its glorious benefits) baked into the formula. And we’re not just talking tinted sunscreen — these days you can find SPF in everything from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lip-plumping glosses</a> and shimmer shadows to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>ultra-luxe foundations</a> and do-it-all multisticks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That being said, not all makeup products with SPF are made equal. SPF is notoriously difficult to work with in formulas, and even without the protective benefits, the makeup still has to perform well. That’s why we took the trial and error into our own hands, testing 36 different SPF-packed makeup products in both our lab and the real world over a two week period. Through our testing, we thoroughly analyzed how each product performed, taking notes on the coverage, blendability, finish, and shade options of every foundation, blush, eyeshadow, and lip product; as well as taking into account how easy each formula was to apply, whether the SPF had any white cast, and how the product held up over the course of a day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the end we narrowed the list down to 10 stellar formulas that make skin look beautiful and provide a boost of extra sun protection.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-univeral-colorescience-sunforgettable-total-protection-color-balm-spf-50></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Univeral</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Colorescience Sunforgettable Total Protection Color Balm SPF 50</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Colorescience Sunforgettable Total Protection Color Balm SPF 50" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/scK7mJAMYAAi1kj6GGB-EFVqKmI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/colorscience-sunforgettable-total-protection-color-balm-spf-50-b735089675b0421fac5a3183db9cd74b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Colorscience</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The multi-use balm has a surprisingly creamy, blendable texture despite its stick format.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The pigment is quite strong, which can be problematic for lighter skin tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cream multisticks</a>, it’s hard to find one that checks all the boxes — we want something creamy but seriously long-lasting, with top-notch color payoff and a natural, hydrating finish. Colorscience Sunforgettable Total Protection Color Balm delivers on all fronts, not to mention the added sun protection benefit thanks to its SPF-infused formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The balm performed exactly how a high-quality cream blush should: We found it to be ultra-blendable and subtly hydrating, plus, it imparted a natural flush of color that lasted all day long. These qualities make the additional sun protection (at a whopping SPF 50) feel like an impressive feat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bear in mind that the pigment is certainly strong. We noticed that one to two swipes was perfect for those with medium to dark skin tones, but the same was a little overwhelming on lighter complexions. That being said, the product is both buildable and blendable, meaning color payoff can easily be customized by blending the product into the skin (for a lighter finish) or layering swipes (for more of a pop).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a bonus, the balm can also be used on lips! “You can’t forget the lips when it comes to sun protection,” Dr. Shari Sperling, a New Jersey-based board certified dermatologist warns. “The lips can still burn if they’re not properly protected. This is a great option with SPF 50.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF Level: </strong>50 | <strong>Shades: </strong>3 | <strong>Size: </strong>0.32 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-matte-foundation-armani-beauty-power-fabric--full-coverage-liquid-foundation-with-spf-25></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Matte Foundation</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Armani Beauty Power Fabric + Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Armani Beauty Power Fabric + Full Coverage Liquid Foundation with SPF 25" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zhxvGJaERGWx0VpRPXmkSzBLOfY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/armani-power-fabric---foundation-0960eec8106b4432a541e1abd124033e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Armani</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The transfer-proof foundation gives a matte, your-skin-but-better finish.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> For those with dry skin, the formula can settle into fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Armani Power Fabric+ Foundation promises 24-hour, transfer- and water-resistant wear with a soft matte finish. And if our wear test was any indication, the liquid-to-powder formula lives up to those claims. We found the matte foundation to be both long-wearing and virtually transfer-proof, while still feeling lightweight on the skin. The added SPF 25 feels like the cherry on top of an already good product rather than a make-or-break-it factor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Interestingly enough, this foundation performed far better in our real world test versus in the lab — we believe this is because we paired it with a primer in the real world. When used with a primer, we were able to get more coverage with less product, and our complexion still looked fresh at the end of the day. Because of this, we definitely recommend using a primer in tandem with the foundation for the best results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The formula also wore beautifully with combination, normal, and oily skin types — but it was notably less favorable for those with dry skin. Drier skin types may find the foundation dehydrating and cakey, settling into lines around the eyes and mouth. Still, proper preparation and the use of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hydrating primer</a> can greatly reduce those effects.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF Level: </strong>25 | <strong>Shades: </strong>30 | <strong>Size: </strong>1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-foundation-for-sensitive-skin-bareminerals-original-loose-powder-mineral-foundation-spf-15></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Foundation for Sensitive Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>bareMinerals Loose Powder</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="bareMinerals Original Loose Powder Mineral Foundation SPF 15" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MAC303Bsb6AK2sdK31SEt_lkWEs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bareminerals-original-loose-powder-foundation-05f91999d9a145bf8f239a438a7c7db1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>bareMinerals</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The powder turns into a light cream upon application, which makes blending a dream and keeps patchiness to a minimum.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We found that the darker hues have an underlying white cast, likely due to the added SPF coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with just five mineral ingredients, the simplistic, talc-free formula worked beautifully on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sensitive skin</a> (no irritation, even with a full day's wear!), masking uneven tone and noticeable pores with ease despite a somewhat-tricky application process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We really had to take our time applying and building up the powder — it just didn’t provide an even finish when we went in with a lot of powder from the jump. But when applied correctly, little by little, the foundation seamlessly buffed into skin for a true our-skin-but-better finish that’s nearly undetectable as makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our biggest issue with the product is the slight white cast it gives medium to deep complexions. While this problem could theoretically be helped by opting for a color a few shades darker than your go-to, it makes for a confusing shade-matching process. Still, we think this is a great option for all skin tones — and Dr. Sperling agrees, especially because it’s easy to reapply this throughout the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF Level: </strong>15 | <strong>Shades: </strong>30 | <strong>Size: </strong>0.28 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-foundation-for-oily-skin-la-mer-the-soft-moisture-powder-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Foundation for Oily Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>La Mer Powder Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="La Mer The Soft Moisture Powder Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uWx3JX8K3lMzmAfaGptYpHduP0c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/la-mer-the-soft-moisture-powder-foundation-daad922ad87e4ed296fc55168ee98943.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>La Mer</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The powder formula curbs shininess without being cakey or settling into fine lines.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We expect far more than 11 shades from our foundations, especially one with such a high price tag.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Using the words “moisture” and “powder” in the same product description feels…wrong. But when it comes to La Mer Soft Moisture Powder Foundation, the wording is spot-on. This option instantly sopped up excess oil (an impressive characteristic that earned it our best for oily skin superlative), but it also left our skin feeling soft and silky, with a velvet-y finish. While most powders dry skin out, this one was oddly moisturizing and enhanced our complexion by blurring imperfections, softening fine lines, and creating a more even-toned appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, this is not your grandmother’s stuffy powder foundation. And while the formula gets all credit for the weightless, silky texture, the included dual-sided sponge allowed us to really customize coverage: The softer side created a sheer, luminous finish while the textured side built coverage and helped conceal imperfections.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Given its stellar performance, it’s a shame the foundation only comes in 11 shades, the latter half of which seem very orange. So while the formula itself is a win, it’s not going to serve a whole lot of people due to the lack of inclusive shading.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF Level: </strong>30 | <strong>Shades: </strong>11 | <strong>Size: </strong>0.34 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-foundation-for-dry-skin-dior-dreamskin-fresh--perfect-cushion-broad-spectrum-spf-50></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Foundation for Dry Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dior Fresh & Perfect Cushion Broad Spectrum SPF 50</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dior Dreamskin Fresh &amp;amp; Perfect Cushion Broad Spectrum SPF 50" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wq47reYY7W0NivWzTPBakvOkyfA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dior-Dreamskin-Fresh--Perfect-Cushion-Broad-Spectrum-SPF-50-0a977ae7e359413fa9c958b1f72dc2b2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The foundation provides airbrush-like coverage while still feeling lightweight and hydrating on the skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The three-option shade range is pretty abysmal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There aren’t many cushion compact foundations in the U.S. market — the format seems to be far more popular overseas. Luckily, we have Dior Dreamskin Fresh & Perfect Cushion, which seriously delivers on the dream skin front. Infused with hydrating ingredients, like vegetable glycerin, this foundation did wonders for dry skin in our test, keeping it moisturized and comfortable through an entire day's wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite being so moisturizing, the light, buildable coverage felt barely there on our skin and gave us a natural, slightly dewy finish that didn't settle into any fine lines or wrinkles. Truly, we were overall impressed with how it left our skin looking somehow matte and luminous in all the right places.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s our issue: Though La Mer’s 11-option shade range is disappointing, Dior somehow manages to do even worse, with just three shades that range from very light to lighter-medium. It’s disappointing to say the least, not to mention a disservice to what is otherwise a great product.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF Level: </strong>50 PA+++ | <strong>Shades: </strong>3 | <strong>Size: </strong>0.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-powder-foundation-pr-4-in-1-pressed-mineral-makeup></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Powder Foundation</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PÜR Pressed Mineral Makeup</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="P&amp;Uuml;R 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/30XWInLfJOfaO9Av3LD8cXjp-XA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pur-4-in-1-pressed-mineral-makeup-86482f8e2632473da975d49eddb0a651.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PÜR</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This powder has light but buildable coverage and feels like nothing on the skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>A lot of product is needed to cover blemishes and imperfections.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Powder foundation, especially powder foundation with SPF, is often used more as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>setting powder</a> than as a true, all-over foundation. Thinking about the PÜR 4-in-1 Pressed Mineral Makeup in that way, it delivers on nearly all fronts.

They gave us the perfect pop of color and shimmer for an everyday look — they’re certainly pigmented and luminous, but not overwhelming or outright glittery. Best of all, once the product dried down it did not budge; we’re talking no creasing, no smudging, and absolutely no fading throughout the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Oddly enough, we found that the shadows were harder to apply and more prone to creasing when used with a primer.

And what better way to give them that protection than with an SPF-infused, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>subtly tinted balm</a>? Packed with shea butter, avocado oil, and olive oil for long-lasting moisture, MDSolarSciences Hydrating Sheer Lip Balm was developed by dermatologists — so it’s legit. In our lab and real world tests, the product clung to our lips without feeling sticky and deposited the perfect tint of color. And, with seven different shades to choose from (including a non-tinted option), there’s bound to be the perfect hue for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The balm sits in the sweet spot between matte and outright glossy, making it a great everyday lip product. While the tints are somewhat muted, they’re easily buildable and allow for complete customization. Perhaps best of all, we were thoroughly impressed with its lasting power — while some balms require touch-ups every half-hour or so, this one lasted multiple hours without the mad urge to reapply all the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One important thing to note: If you’re actively dealing with dryness and flakey lips, this might not be the balm for you. While it is certainly hydrating, it simply didn’t pack enough punch in the moisture department for those with very dry lips. That being said, even those of us who needed a bit more on the moisture front were thoroughly impressed by the smooth texture and gorgeous tint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF Level: </strong>30 | <strong>Shades: </strong>7 | <strong>Size: </strong>0.15 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lip-plumper-sunnie-skin-plump-it-lips-hyaluronic--spf-30-lip-plumper></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lip Plumper</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sunnie Skin Plump It Lips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sunnie Skin Plump It Lips w/ Hyaluronic Acid" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lBoXXHDquYnwY_aW_5903Sm4EP8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sunnie-skin-plump-it-lips-w-hyaluronic-acid-b429359a1a9649ca91acffacf68023ae.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sunnie Skin</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The product feels surprisingly hydrating.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The plumping properties may make lips (and the surrounding skin) turn bright pink or even red.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sunnie Skin Plump It Lips With Hyaluronic Acid might be the first lip product we’ve ever found that simultaneously plumps, protects, and moisturizes. It wears like a true gloss — tacky and slightly oily in texture with a high-shine finish — but performs more like a balm: It provides deep hydration and protects from sun damage, which is a pretty remarkable feat given it also acts as a plumper.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the gloss itself is clear, the plumping effects gave our lips a slight pink/red tint. And it really does work to plump the lips — we noticed a natural sort of swelling almost akin to temporary filler (though no topical treatment will ever truly match the effects of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>injectables</a>). Luckily, the plumping feels fairly subtle, and is more cooling and tingly than hot and itchy. Just be careful not to apply too liberally, as we found that the swelling sensation can irritate the surrounding skin. A little goes a long way with this sort of product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With an SPF of 30, it feels like the ultimate multifunctional lip product.

That being said, both Dr. Sperling and Boston-based board certified dermatologist, Dr. Ranella Hirsch agree that makeup with SPF should be looked at as an opportunity for bonus coverage and protection, not as your main source of SPF.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to SPF in makeup, you’re rarely, if ever, going to use the amount of product needed to get the full benefits. Realistically, you’d need to use about a third of a teaspoon to get adequate protection from your makeup with SPF, which, when applied to your face “would look like spackle,” says Dr. Hirsch (i.e. not a cute look).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for straight sunscreen, Dr. Sperling suggests using an SPF of 30 at minimum. But when it comes to SPF in makeup, the number itself isn’t so important — just think of it as some extra protection. As New York City-based professional makeup artist, Brittany Lo puts it: “Makeup with SPF only helps and is better than wearing no SPF at all, but it won't work as effectively as using sunscreen directly on your skin.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Makeup Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From a formulation standpoint, working SPF into a makeup product is tricky. And because any protection you get from makeup should just supplement your main source of SPF, we suggest only incorporating makeup products with SPF that you’d use regardless of their sun protection. This is especially true considering the fact that you likely won’t use enough product to get the full SPF benefits listed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For example, we love the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Colorscience Sunforgettable Total Protection Color Balm</a> because it has gorgeous, buildable color payoff and a creamy texture that blends with ease. The SPF is just the cherry on top of an already great product. “If it's a strong enough formula, it should feel and apply like it doesn't have SPF in it,” Lo says. “You shouldn’t have to worry about a white cast or anything like that”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also keep in mind that most makeup products with SPF fall into the complexion or lips category — think foundation or lip balms. There are also some eye products, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Supergoop! Shimmershade Illuminating Cream Eyeshadow</a>, that contain SPF, but these formulations are few and far between.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You should consider skin type when it comes to makeup products with SPF, the same way you should consider skin type when choosing traditional makeup products, sunscreens, and skincare.

SPF in makeup definitely works, but it’s unlikely that you’ll receive the full SPF protection listed on the packaging. Unless you use around a third of a teaspoon worth of product (which is a quite substantial amount), you’re not getting the SPF coverage advertised. That’s why both Dr. Hirsch and Dr. Sperling suggest wearing sunscreen underneath makeup with SPF in it. “That’s always my recommendation,” Dr. Hirsch says. “Wear sunscreen to get the job done and the makeup with SPF as a bonus.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do I need to wear sunscreen under makeup that includes SPF?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You should absolutely still wear sunscreen under makeup that includes SPF. “I’m never going to have someone rely on SPF in makeup alone,” Dr. Hirsch explains.

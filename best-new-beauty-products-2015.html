We get to see it all: the good, the bad and the peculiar, and we test it all out&nbsp;so that we can report back to you, our readers, exactly which new products are worth your time and your money.</p><p>So if we say that a new product meets our incredibly high standards, you know it’s good—and we’ve made some discoveries recently that are revolutionizing&nbsp;our beauty games in serious ways. From ‘wet skin’ lotion to the ultimate <a href=# id=auto-tag_lip-gloss data-tag=lip-gloss>lip gloss</a> hybrids, we’ve rounded up the best new <a href=# id=auto-tag_beauty-products data-tag=beauty-products>beauty products</a> to make 2015 your most gorgeous year ever.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/beautyproducts.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/biodance-collagen-mask-tiktok.png><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sonic-toothbrush-w-accesssories.jpg alt="Sonic Toothbrush w accesssories" width=222 height=670 sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>What:</strong> GO SMiLE Sonic Blue Teeth Whitening System <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">($129, GoSmile.com)</a></p><p><strong>Why:</strong> The perfect marriage of sonic toothbrush and a whitening system promises to reveal a brilliant smile in record time—a few days to be exact. We love that the rechargeable two-speed toothbrush tackles oral health concerns like plaque, gum disease, and gingivitis. The ultimate perk? The winning combo of blue LED lights and teeth whitening gel erases stains inside and out. Say hello to pristine pearly whites!</p><p><strong>Expert Take:</strong> “The LED light is the most ground-breaking feature of this product, and with or without the gel, it is still an outstanding product that will clean and whiten your teeth” explains <strong>Dr. Maryann Lehmann, B.S., D.D.S.</strong>, a cosmetic dentist and tooth color analysis researcher. “The brush-on whitening gel is a new way of using at-home whitening products that are fast and effective. It is fun to use, looks very stylish, and makes brushing your teeth something to look forward to doing.”</p><p><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Foods That Actually Whiten Your Teeth</a></strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/flashmud_jar-2.jpg alt="SONY DSC" width=600 height=587 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>What:</strong> GLAMGLOW FLASHMUD Brightening Treatment (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">$69, Sephora.com)</a></p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Dark spots and an uneven skin tone can leave you feel less than glowing. Just in time for summer, GlamGlow revealed their latest product—a radiance boosting mud mask—designed to brighten, tone, and exfoliate a series of quick 20-minute treatments. A combination of&nbsp;proprietary ingredients ranging from WhiteEnergy (white wild rose flower, white lily bulb, white birch bark, white jasmine flower, white peony root, and white tea leaf) to Reflectrum (acetyl glucosamine, niacinamide, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, and diamond photoluminescence), will leave your skin feeling soft, smooth, and picture perfect.</p><p><strong>Expert Take:</strong> “All of GLAMGLOW’s products are innovative and disruptive—meaning they’ve never been done like this before,” explains <strong>Glenn Dellimore</strong>, co-founder of GLAMGLOW. “We definitely felt there was a need for a brightening treatment that provides instant results. Our patented TEAOXI® technology delivers natural betulin, betulinic acid, and ellagic acid (from real pieces of white birch leaf )to lighten, brighten and even out skin tone. While, ellagic acid is a highly effective skin brightener, lauded as a safer alternative to hydroquinone.”</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sleep-mask-body.jpg alt="Sleep Mask Body" width=399 height=670 sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>What:</strong> James Read Express Mask Tan for Face<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> ($45) </a>or Body<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> ($62, Netaporter.com)</a></p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Not so newsflash! Baking in the sun is well…bad for you. But we confess, there’s something irresistible about having an endless summer glow. Enter James Read’s new take on <a href=# id=auto-tag_self-tanning data-tag=self-tanning>self-tanning</a>—an ingenious overnight treatment that allows you to wash and go to sleep without the risk of harming your pristine white sheets. Results develop in around 30 minutes giving you a preview of what’s to come before morning time. Plus, a cooling blend of caffeine and mint extracts immediately make your skin feel more toned.</p><p><strong>Expert Take</strong>: “It’s like your average face/body cream—with the added bonus of giving you a natural-looking tan overnight,” explains founder <strong>James Read</strong>. “It doesn’t smell like traditional <a href=# id=auto-tag_self-tanner data-tag=self-tanner>self tanner</a> or transfer onto your bedding. Now, you can simply wake up, shower, have a great color, and great feeling skin. All my celeb clients like <strong>Rosie Huntington Whiteley</strong>, <strong>Jessie J</strong>, <strong>Ellie Goulding </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Lara Stone</strong> are obsessed with it—Rosie said its the best self-tanner she has ever used!”</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=# rel=noopener>How to get Your Best Summer Skin Ever</a></strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/coconut-final-fop.jpg alt=Coconut-final-FOP width=220 height=670 sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>What:</strong> Jergens Wet Skin <a href=# id=auto-tag_moisturizer data-tag=moisturizer>Moisturizer</a> (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">$6.99, drugstores in August 2015</a>)</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> Waiting to dry off before applying lotion is so 2014. In less than one month, you can look forward to instantly locking in moisture straight out of the shower. Get ready to redefine your cumbersome thoughts on applying lotion. The unique formula blends into wet (or damp) skin leaving skin with a hydrated, luminous sheen in half the&nbsp; prep time. You’ll be sure to fall in love with one of&nbsp; the three new fragrances: Monoi Oil, Coconut Oil or Green Tea Oil.</p><p><strong>Expert Take:</strong> “Jergens is known for moisturizing—that’s our heritage and what we do best,” explains <strong>Vivian Bastos</strong>, Jergens Brand Manager. “It’s also a well-known fact&nbsp;that the best time to moisturize is right out of the shower, when your skin is most ready to lock in that moisture. Our proprietary formula binds oil to water to help the lotion instantly absorb and lock in moisture on wet skin. Applying lotion while wet may take a while to get used to,&nbsp; but once you start using it every day, this product will redefine the way you use lotion. You’ll wonder how you ever lived without it!”</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen-shot-2015-07-19-at-9-44-11-pm.png alt="Screen shot 2015-07-19 at 9.44.11 PM" width=244 height=521 sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><strong>What:</strong> YSL Beaute VOLUPTÉ TINT-IN-OIL<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> ($32, yslbeautyus.com)</a></p><p><strong>Why:</strong> It’s hard to invent the wheel, especially when it comes to classic lip color. However, in the heartland of cosmetic innovation, YSL Beaute cleverly combined a tint, gloss and lip balm all rolled into one for a sexy “bitten” lip effect. Available in eight sexy sheer shades, the formula effortlessly glides on dry lips without annoying sticky texture or awkward color fade. Plus, it comes with the signature ‘bouche à bouche’ applicator, adding an ultra-feminine touch to a traditional makeup ritual.</p><p><strong>Expert Take:</strong> “We use oil on our hair and skin so it’s makes sense to add it to our lips,” explains <strong>Dell Ashley</strong>, YSL Beaute US Director of Makeup. “ It is very difficult to add tint to an oil, because they tend to separate— this what makes this product so ground breaking. The combination of coriander, apricot, jojoba, passion flower, and macadamia oils make Tint-in-Oil a hydrating must-have for any beauty cabinet. [You’ll also get] the high shine, wet, luxurious lips you see in the magazines in just one step.”</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=# rel=noopener>Here’s How to Pull Off Hot Pink Lips</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWSBd4SXbGhompWowW66xLBkm52RqsG6ec%2Brpp2tk6nAbn6Pamxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

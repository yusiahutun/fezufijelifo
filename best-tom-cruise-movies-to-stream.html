Here are 10 of the best Tom Cruise movies to stream.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=update-10-21-22>UPDATE: 10/21/22</h3><p>We've reviewed our guide and replaced links that had stopped working.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Stream Liam Neeson's Action Thriller Movies in 2022</a></span></p><h2 id=collateral>Collateral</h2><p>Tom Cruise is genuinely scary as a suave hitman in Michael Mann's slick crime thriller. Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver who unknowingly picks up Cruise's contract killer and agrees to drive him to various locations for a hefty sum. Foxx's Max Durocher soon discovers that the man he knows as Vincent is actually on a killing spree, murdering different targets at each stop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mann builds a tense back-and-forth between the two men, making them into worthy adversaries even though Vincent seems to have every advantage. Mann gives Los Angeles at night a gorgeous, otherworldly feel, the perfect backdrop for this battle between the sadistic and the noble.</p><p>Collateral&nbsp;is streaming on <a href=#>Netflix</a> ($9.99+ per month) and <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Paramount+</a> ($4.99+ per month after a seven-day free trial) and is available for digital purchase ($9.99+) and rental ($2.99+) at <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iTunes</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Google Play</a>, <a href=#>Vudu</a>, and other digital outlets.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>Watch on Netflix</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Paramount+</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Google Play</a><a href=#>Watch on Vudu</a></span></p><h2 id=the-color-of-money>The Color of Money</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before "legacy sequels" were all the rage, Martin Scorsese directed this 25-years-later follow-up to 1961's The Hustler, with Paul Newman returning as pool shark Fast Eddie Felson. Eddie is older but not necessarily wiser, and his love for the game is rekindled when he spots hotshot young player Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise).</p><p>Cruise and Newman have excellent chemistry as two control freaks who develop a wary respect but maintain their rivalry. Scorsese shoots the pool scenes with flair, bringing a dynamic excitement to the many games of nine-ball. The movie is a winning combination of Scorsese's cinematic creativity and the Hollywood charisma of its two stars.</p><p>The Color of Money is is available for digital purchase ($9.99+) and rental ($3.99) at <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iTunes</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Google Play</a>, <a href=#>Vudu</a>, and other digital outlets.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on iTunes</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Google Play</a><a href=#>Watch on Vudu</a></span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Best Nicolas Cage Movies to Stream in 2023</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=edge-of-tomorrow>Edge of Tomorrow</h2><p>Although it underwhelmed at the box office, Doug Liman's sci-fi action movie has proven worthy of its critical acclaim by building a dedicated following. Tom Cruise plays against his action-hero type as a whiny, self-serving military public affairs officer. He's thrown into the middle of a battle against aliens and finds himself in a time loop, returning to the same point every time he gets killed.</p><p>Emily Blunt plays the hardened battlefield sergeant who trains him to harness this unexpected ability. It's a clever, fast-paced, and playful take on a familiar sci-fi concept, with Cruise and Blunt making a perfect team of reluctant allies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Edge of Tomorrow is available for digital purchase ($9.99+) and rental ($3.99) at <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iTunes</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Google Play</a>, <a href=#>Vudu</a>, and other digital outlets.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on iTunes</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Google Play</a><a href=#>Watch on Vudu</a></span></p><h2 id=interview-with-the-vampire>Interview With the Vampire</h2><p>Author Anne Rice was initially outraged by the casting of Tom Cruise as her popular vampire character Lestat de Lioncourt, but she changed her mind completely after seeing Neil Jordan's film. Cruise may be an unlikely choice to play the decadent, narcissistic Lestat, but he captures the dark hedonism of Rice's vampires perfectly.</p><p>Brad Pitt matches him as Lestat's protégé Louis, and Kirsten Dunst gives one of the best-ever child performances as forever-young vampire Claudia. Jordan brings the eroticism and menace of Rice's vampires to life, telling a centuries-spanning story as narrated by Louis to a rapt reporter played by Christian Slater.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interview With the Vampire&nbsp;is streaming for free with ads on <a href=#>Tubi</a> and is&nbsp;available for digital purchase ($7.99+) and rental ($3.99) from <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iTunes</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Google Play</a>, <a href=#>Vudu</a>, and other digital outlets.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>Watch on Tubi</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on iTunes</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Google Play</a></span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Best Free Action Movies to Stream in 2023</a></span></p><h2 id=jerry-maguire>Jerry Maguire</h2><p>Jerry Maguire's catch phrases have been so extensively quoted and recycled that it's easy to forget this movie is more than just a collection of quips. It's a passionate, open-hearted romantic comedy from a master of the form, writer-director Cameron Crowe, and it features one of Tom Cruise's most purely likable performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He plays the title character, an idealistic sports agent who leaves his secure job to start his own firm with just one client, NFL wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.). Jerry approaches negotiating with the same enthusiasm and honesty that he brings to his romance with single mother Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger).</p><p>Jerry Maguire is streaming on <a href=#>HBO Max</a> ($9.99+ per month) and is available for digital purchase ($12.99+) and rental ($2.99+) from <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iTunes</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Google Play</a>, <a href=#>Vudu</a>, and other digital outlets.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>Watch on HBO Max</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on iTunes</a><a href=#>Watch on Vudu</a></span></p><h2 id=magnolia>Magnolia</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Cruise is only one part of writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's sprawling, multi-character epic, but he may be the most memorable part. Cruise was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of chauvinistic motivational speaker Frank T.J. Mackey, who's long estranged from his father Earl (Jason Robards).</p><p>Frank's arc of reconciling his feelings about his father ties into the movie's overall theme of redemption and forgiveness, which plays out in multiple overlapping storylines. The stellar cast also includes Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and William H. Macy, but even among such amazing talent, Cruise stands out.</p><p>Magnolia is streaming for free via local libraries on <a href=#>Kanopy</a>.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>Watch on Kanopy</a></span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Best Stephen King Movies to Stream in 2023</a></span></p><h2 id=mission-impossible---ghost-protocol>Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Mission: Impossible movies have become an all-consuming project for Tom Cruise in recent years, and they remain one of the most satisfying blockbuster franchises in Hollywood. The series reached an apex with this fourth movie, directed by animation veteran Brad Bird.</p><p>Bird brings an animator's anything-goes approach to the movie's massive set pieces, including Cruise's Ethan Hunt climbing the side of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, still one of the greatest stunts ever captured onscreen. He also puts together a top-notch team to support Cruise, adding Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner as Ethan's fellow covert agents, and promoting Simon Pegg in what would become a key franchise role.</p><p>Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is streaming on&nbsp;<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Paramount+</a> ($4.99+ per month after a seven-day free trial).</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Kanopy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oblivion>Oblivion</h2><p>A sci-fi movie focused as much on creative design and heady ideas as it is on action, Oblivion stars Tom Cruise as one of the last people left on Earth, ostensibly guarding the last remnants of human civilization following a deadly alien invasion. Cruise's Jack Harper and his partner Victoria Olson (Andrea Riseborough) start to realize that something isn't right about their supposed mission to repair essential technology before joining the human race's migration into space.</p><p>Oblivion is full of plot twists that don't always make sense, but Cruise convincingly plays every emotional reaction. He pulls the audience along on this sleek, mind-bending future journey.</p><p>Oblivion is available for digital purchase ($11.99+) and rental ($3.99) at <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iTunes</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Google Play</a>, <a href=#>Vudu</a>, and other digital outlets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on iTunes</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Google Play</a><a href=#>Watch on Vudu</a></span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Best Movies on Netflix in 2023</a></span></p><h2 id=risky-business>Risky Business</h2><p>Anyone who only knows Risky Business from the often-parodied moment of Tom Cruise dancing in his underwear may be surprised to discover an emotionally engaging and sometimes dark coming-of-age dramedy. It's a bit like a cross between Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Graduate, with Cruise as a recent high school graduate who finds a connection with a prostitute played by Rebecca De Mornay.</p><p>It features the requisite crazy parties and occasionally crass jokes of an '80s teen comedy, but that's balanced by a strong undercurrent of melancholy. Cruise captures the emptiness of a privileged teen staring into a predetermined future that he starts to realize may be meaningless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Risky Business is streaming on <a href=#>Netflix</a> ($9.99+ per month) and&nbsp;<a href=#>HBO Max</a> ($9.99+ per month).</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>Watch on Netflix</a><a href=#>Watch on HBO Max</a></span></p><h2 id=valkyrie>Valkyrie</h2><p>Tom Cruise is probably not the first name that would come to mind to play a German officer during World War II, but the filmmakers behind Valkyrie pull it off. They cast Cruise and actors of various nationalities as the members of a secret German organization that conspired to assassinate Adolf Hitler, and nearly succeeded.</p><p>Set in the waning days of the war, Valkyrie generates plenty of suspense, even though anyone watching almost certainly already knows the outcome. It's a fascinating history lesson, a taut thriller, and a true ensemble piece. Cruise plays the man in charge of the plan, but he makes room for the likes of Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and Kenneth Branagh, all working toward the same goal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Valkyrie is available for digital purchase ($12.99+) and rental ($3.99) at <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iTunes</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Google Play</a>, <a href=#>Vudu</a>, and other digital outlets.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on iTunes</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Watch on Google Play</a><a href=#>Watch on Vudu</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvaW1ka35wrsSsq2asn6J6pL7UoqqeZZ2kw6qx0marqGWjqb%2Bmrcxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Jared apologized for his “slip-up.” However, it didn’t come without severe backlash from his fellow houseguests.</strong></p><p>Just weeks ago, Luke Valentine used an offensive slur and was kicked off the <a href=#>CBS</a> show. Now, Jared Fields has used an offensive slur that has viewers calling for him to be removed. He has since apologized to Cory for using the derogatory word to describe America Lopez, calling it a “slip up” in the HOH Room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/09/GettyImages-1572667035-1024x683.jpg><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-big-brother-jared-uses-offensive-word>Big Brother Jared uses offensive word</h2><p>Big Brother’s Jared used the r-word, <a href=# rel=nofollow>which is</a> “a word for a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>person&nbsp;with a&nbsp;learning&nbsp;disability&nbsp;(= a&nbsp;condition&nbsp;that can have an&nbsp;effect&nbsp;on someone’s&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn&nbsp;easily), which was used by&nbsp;doctors<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the past but is now<strong>&nbsp;</strong>extremely<strong>&nbsp;</strong>offensive” and derogatory. He used the word to describe fellow houseguest, America Lopez.</p><p>Jared confronted Cory Wurtenberger while Izzy Gleicher was there. “I don’t think she’s (America) the R-word. I slipped up. I’m sorry about that,” Jared said to Cory.</p><p>He said he’s “obviously angry” and “willing to admit that.” Jared added, “At the end of the day, I need you to see where I’m coming from. The moment somebody does not choose to benefit my game…”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-big-brother-s-code-of-conduct>What is Big Brother’s code of conduct?</h2><p>Matt Turner from <a href=#>Big Brother</a> 24 posted part of the Code of Conduct by CBS for the feeds. In the Code of Conduct, using negative speech or slurs against people with a disability is forbidden.</p><p>When Luke Valentine used a racial slur, CBS wrote: “Luke violated the Big Brother code of conduct and there is zero tolerance in the house for using a racial slur. He has been removed from the house.”</p><p>Other rules are that they shall have no contact with the outside world while housemates must wear microphone lapels at all times, except when swimming or sleeping.</p><p><strong>GRV Media and Reality Titbit have contacted CBS for comment.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jared had apparently called America the R Word. <a href=#>#bb25</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2vCxBOHu5W</a></p>— 🔥 BBXtra 🔥 (@BigBrotherXtra) <a href=#>September 2, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-want-jared-to-be-removed>Fans want Jared to be removed</h2><p>One viewer said: “@CBSBigBrother where is the energy for the r-word? It’s unacceptable.” Another penned: “He did, why is he still in the house? That’s against BB rules. Jared go home!”</p><p>“He should be removed from the house,” reacted a fellow fan after seeing Jared on Big Brother 25 reference the R-word during a recent episode.</p><p>One fan wrote: “@CBSBigBrother Please inform production that this is an ableist slur, and therefore it is against the established Code of Conduct.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The R word is very demeaning and problematic, and shouldn’t be used period. I doubt they will expel Jared since we didn’t actually see him saying it, although he referenced it. Now will they penalize him?

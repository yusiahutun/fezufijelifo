His father and his sister both confirmed that the money came in – but they have pretty different thoughts on the scenario.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“First of all, I got to send shouts out to Atlantic Records man. They gave my son a big boy chance. Gucci – I got to send shouts out to Gucci too. Y’all might not like it but I got to give my boy what he did, man,” Scarr’s father began. “He gave my son a major major chance man. I can’t let y’all throw dude under the bus like that. Come on now, the truth is the truth, man. I gave nobody permission to do that.</p><p>“I ain’t looking for nothing, I just want what rightfully belong to my son,” he continued. “I ain’t asking for nothing else. I don’t want nothing else. They sent they 10 bands. Gucci, he sent his 10 bands. I covered the rest. I appreciate that big time. Certain things was said that shouldn’t have been said. It was wrong. Man to man, I wish somebody woulda just dialed my [number] and talked to your guy 100. All this out of control.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He added: “Gucci and them was the best thing that ever happened to my son. Nobody deserves this here. Shouts out to everybody who sent flowers. Gucci sent flowers. He did what he could. He ain’t have to do none of that. I just wish I was the one being talked to so we could have that understood.”</p><p>Scarr’s sister, however, felt that the money was a drop in the bucket for Gucci and he should have done way more.</p><p>“That 10k ain’t did shit but buy obituaries and flowers, boo. Yeah Gucci sent 10,000 and somebody else sent another 10 so it was 20,000 in all. And we ain’t get the flowers… I don’t give a fuck what nobody say. Gucci ain’t help with shit… My brother’s funeral was $60k in all. It’s still fuck him. What’s 10 to 60? What is 10k to 60?”</p><p>Over the weekend, Scarr’s close friend and collaborator Quezz Ruthless blasted Gucci for allegedly promising to pay for his former signee’s funeral, then ghosting his family when it was time to deliver.</p><p>“You say to them you finna pay for the funeral, then you lie,” Quezz said. “You didn’t have to lie! You ain’t have to go ghost either, cuh. It was gonna get paid for either way. You could’ve just said you ain’t have the money. You don’t get no type of respect for that, cuh.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He added: “The minute that them folks called yo phone to see if you gon’ pay for the funeral, you blocked them. That’s not real, cuh. You ain’t straight. You only trying to act all real. You posted Scarr talking ’bout some long live — bruh, you ain’t do nothing, cuh.”</p><p>Quezz also claimed Gucci Mane asked Scarr’s family to return the rapper’s 1017 chains following his death, which Scarr’s sister co-signed and both said the chains wouldn’t be returned.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/12/big-scarr-gucci-mane-1017-records-died-aged-22-250x142.jpeg alt="Big Scarr Of Gucci Mane’s 1017 Records Has Died Aged 22" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Big Scarr Of Gucci Mane’s 1017 Records Has Died Aged 22</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 22, 2022</p></a><p>“OMM he not getting them chains back!!” she wrote on social media. “YES He asked for the chains back & NO he not getting them hos back!!

Gotta get in back in blood!!!!”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Gucci Mane was not present at the funeral. In her posts sharing receipts, his wife added that no one thanked him for sending flowers.</p><p>“20k total @laflare1017 what u did to these folks man,” she wrote before adding in a separate post: “We also sent flowers & not even a thank u” along with a breaking heart emoji.</p><p>Big Scarr (real name Alexander Woods) was at his girlfriend’s home in his native Memphis when he died after <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>ingesting a lethal amount of prescription pills</a>. It’s unclear what medication was taken specifically, nor whether the drugs had been prescribed to Scarr.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miZop9dqLCivtFmnZqsmJq%2Fbr%2FIrKueql2nsrS8zqebZp%2BlmLCqecyapZ5lp56zpg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Originally, when an event was black-tie formal, it meant that men should wear tuxedos. Of course anyone—no matter their gender identity—can wear a suit or a dress, so the functionalities of the term are a little different. We’ll get into the details below.</p><h2><strong>Gown Or No Gown: Do I Have An Option?</strong></h2><p>Apart from white-tie affairs—which aren’t common—black tie is the most formal dress code you’ll probably face when to comes to weddings or galas. For those who wish to wear a dress, it’s customary to wear floor-length gowns, though exceptions can be made.</p><p>Don’t own a gown and don’t particularly want to buy one for a one-off occasion? It’s perfectly&nbsp;acceptable&nbsp;to wear a cocktail dress you already have. However, if you&nbsp;do go this route, just make sure to keep the colors rich (black, jewel tones, chic metallics, brown) so as not to look too casual. Conversely, you can wear a floor-length gown in a lighter shade, since the silhouette is inherently dressy.</p><p>Another acceptable option for black-tie affairs: Chic separates, such as a silk blouse with a full satin skirt or an elevated suit (if you’d rather skip the tuxedo), work too.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lacana-blue-dress.jpg alt width=650 height=650 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Lascana Pleated V-Neck Dress</h2><p>You’ll easily be the star of the night in this baby blue pleated v-neck dress.

For those who prefer dresses, it means you have the option of wearing a full-length gown, or choosing a <a href=# rel=noopener>cocktail dress</a>—so long as the style is relatively conservative. This often means that longer hemlines are preferred and long slits are not. Essentially, if you choose to wear a shorter or cocktail dress, make sure it’ll hold up in a room full of formal tuxedos and gowns.</p><h2><strong>Wearing Red To A Formal Affair: What’s The Deal?</strong></h2><p>This dated fashion rule was originally put into place during more conservative times when red was thought to be a way-too-sexy, attention-stealing color. Sure, you might want to stay away from wearing a skin-tight red plunging spandex gown to a wedding or black-tie affair, but in this case, the color isn’t the reason why.&nbsp;These days, there are plenty of high-style red dresses that are perfectly acceptable as formal wear. Celebrities often wear red gowns that look elegant and classic, so go ahead and don a red hot look yourself.</p><p>A good rule of thumb: Choose red gowns that are made from rich silky fabrics like chiffon or organza, as opposed to shiny satin or anything too stretchy and always keep embellishments to a minimum.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/revolve-red-dress.jpg alt="NBD Maracuya Gown" width=650 height=650 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>NBD Maracuya Gown</h2><p>There’s no reason you can’t show a little leg, especially if it’s in this <a href=# rel=nofollow>stunning gown from NBD</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lascana-pink.jpg><h2>Niall Midi Dress</h2><p>Yes, cut-outs can work for a black-tie event.

The bustier-style top adds some support, while the wrap-style skirt shows the perfect amount of leg.</p><h2><strong>Wearing White To A Wedding: Yes or No?</strong></h2><p>Despite the fact that etiquette books say it’s perfectly fine to <a href=# rel=noopener>wear a white dress</a> to someone else’s wedding so long as it’s not overtly “bridal,” we say proceed with caution. It’s become a pretty big no-no in modern times and you could run the risk of offending the bride—even if it’s a given that you won’t take away any of her attention. Since most folks are usually clued into the fact that wearing white is a don’t, it might look like you made a conscious effort to cause some drama.</p><p>Your best bet: Save that ethereal white gown for another formal event that’s not a wedding.</p><h2><strong>Covering Up: Jackets, Coats & More</strong></h2><p>Since several formal events take place in colder weather, you’ll need something to keep you warm. However, leave those cardigans, denim jackets and everyday puffers at home and invest in a fur (or faux-fur) jacket or classic overcoat and a chic shawl or cashmere wrap in case you get chilly inside, or for spring and summer affairs.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/revolve-fuzzy-cover-up.jpg alt="Adrienne Landau Faux Fox Fur Short Jacket" width=650 height=650 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Adrienne Landau Faux Fox Fur Short Jacket</h2><p>Now’s the perfect opportunity to go a little bold with your outdoor wear; this faux fox jacket will complement any grown or dress you wear underneath.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/formal-gowns-revolve-.png><h2 class="_6YOLH _1JtW7 _2VF_A _2OMMP">Belted Double Face Wool Blend Wrap Coat</h2><p>Why would you need a basic black or brown coat when you could wear this <a href=# rel=nofollow>light blue option</a> from Bernardo?

Is it acceptable to change into jeans, or is keeping your formal wear on a must? This really depends on the location of the wedding. For example, if your hotel room is easily accessible, a lot of people do change. But if it’s another venue, most people won’t. Feel out the situation to see what others are doing—you certainly don’t want to be the only one in jeans when others are still wearing gowns.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lascana-hot-pink.jpg alt width=650 height=650 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Lascana <span>Asymmetrical Hem Dress</span></h2><p>This asymmetrical hem dress will be perfect for any post-event gatherings.</p><p>A version of this article was originally published in March 2016.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZ6Yra2imnyjuMCcomasmZp6p7vRppilZaearrN5kWtsaW5hZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

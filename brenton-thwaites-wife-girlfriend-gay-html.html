He searched for the place online and fortunately found a house share. Turns out Chloe was one of the roommates.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, the romance between the two emerged. However, both of them remained utterly silent about their romance until they made a public appearance at the premiere of&nbsp;In the Heart of the Sea&nbsp;in late 2015. During the premiere, the couple was first pictured together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>More From Liverampup:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Pregnant Becky Miesner Slides Wedding Date!

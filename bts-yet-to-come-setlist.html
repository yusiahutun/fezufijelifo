According to Amazon, users can sign up for <a href=#>Prime Video’s free trial</a> over and over again as long as it isn’t within the same 12 months. This means that if you if you haven’t been an Amazon Prime member for more than 12 months, you’re eligible to receive another 30 days for free.</p><p>After the free trial ends, <a href=#>Prime Video</a> costs <a href=#>$8.99 per month</a> for non-Prime members.

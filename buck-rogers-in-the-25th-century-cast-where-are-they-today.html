William Rogers and his trusted pals found themselves on a far-out adventure … 500 years after blasting off from earth.</p><p>The concept of the NBC program followed Anthony “Buck” Rogers — played by <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gil Gerard</a>&nbsp;</strong>— who is in charge of the spacecraft Ranger 3 when it is launched in May 1987. However, due to a life-support malfunction, the main character is unfortunately frozen … for 504 years before he finds himself in the year 2491. Whoops! Buck soon learns that society back on earth was rebuilt following a nuclear war and it is now under the protection of the Earth Defense Directorate. That plot was enough for other people to sign on alongside Gil, including <strong>Erin Gray</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Tim O’Connor&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Felix Silla</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/where-is-the-buck-rogers-cast-5.jpg><p>The show — which ran from 1979 to 1981 — did not have great reviews upon its original airing, but it has gained a cult-following in the years since it has been off the air. Erin — who played Wilma Deering — once recalled what it was like when she was first approached with the concept. “When I was shooting Evening in Byzantium, on my last night, which went from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m., the studio called me and said, ‘We’d like you to come in at 10:00 a.m. for screen tests for Buck Rogers,’” Erin <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusively told&nbsp;Closer Weekly</a>.</p><p>“‘I’m sorry, I just finished a four-to-six week shoot and this is my last night and you want me screen test for Buck Rogers? I haven’t read a script. I know nothing about this project. Please let me go home and we can do this another day.’ ‘Nope.’ I came in with such an attitude. And I got the part,'” she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/buck-rogers-cast-8.jpg><p>But looking back now, “There were episodes that I like more than others,” she reflected. “It was a little out there for me in terms of sci-fi. I’m the girl who likes all the cop procedural shows. My first book was, like, Nancy Drew and Agatha Christie and I go from there. I wasn’t into sci-fi except for things like ‘Fahrenheit 451’ or ‘The Twilight Zone’. So I didn’t really know Buck Rogers. One of the biggest things about the show for me was meeting some of the actors that I looked up to, like Anne Jeffreys from Topper — she was my favorite actress growing up. Or Jack Palance, who brought this energy in life to the set.”</p><p><strong>Scroll on down to see where the cast from the classic Science-fiction show is today!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46brJyjXae8qLHRrGSipl2ptaZ5kW6roWWTmru1wdGyZJyZo6l6uLTEq5xmmaKaerW0xLJkraeUlsZw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

I have entered a cafe in which the tables, chairs, decorations and floor have lost all depth. Everything is in plain black-and-white and is utterly cartoonish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Where are you?</strong> It’s all a bit Alice In Wonderland, but this is Cafe Yeonnam-Dong 223-14, named after the district in which it is located, in western Seoul. The disorienting two-tone decor was inspired by a short-lived Korean television show, W, in which the characters are caught partway between the real world and a cartoon existence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A favourite show of one J.S. Lee, he set out to recreate that look and the cafe opened last November. The floor has a black-and-white parquet effect; intricate crests and swirls on the cross beams are remini­scent of stately homes but are in two dimensions only, as are the elegant candle­holders on the walls and a “side­board” that holds two-tone plates, coffee pots and tea cups. Lee is a businessman, though, and the “look” is designed to also appeal to Instagrammers and other social media devotees – of whom there are many on a recent Thursday after­noon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cafe’s fame has spread inter­nation­ally, too, with customers from America and Japan among those hamming it up for their online accounts; 2D or not 2D, that is the question. And it is all deceptively fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/06/28/ce1a180e-97c3-11e9-b82d-cb52a89d5dff_972x_211125.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Are the food and drinks similarly flat?</strong> On the contrary, they are fully rounded. The menu is limited, but what they do, they do well. My lemon yogurt smoothie is generous in scale and refresh­ing on a hot day while the mocha cheese­cake also hits the spot. And while the cafe serves regular hot and iced drinks – a good selection of coffees, fresh juices and teas – there is also a playful side to what it does.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Toy Latte comes with a block figure made from sugar that floats on the foam until it dissolves, while the Popcorn Cafe Frappe is an espresso topped with sweet caramel popcorn. The Choco Choco Frappe is so sweet they had to name it twice, and comes with a chocolate biscuit partly concealed in the foam. Cakes dominate the menu, with the pinkberry and yellow cupcakes eye-catchers in the display cabinet. The staff can whip up croissant sandwiches to order.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">And is it pricey?</strong> No more so than many “mainstream” cafes in central Seoul. Cafe lattes start at 5,500 won (HK$37) and the rest of the menu is in the same ballpark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/06/28/05a0ba46-90e7-11e9-a6c8-8445313d8ede_972x_211125.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Who do the Instagrammers rub shoulders with?</strong> The cafe has attracted a cult following with both fans of cartoons and those who like their food and drink with a twist. On weekends, I’m reliably informed, long queues form outside.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">How would I rediscover that missing dimension?</strong> If this cartoon becomes overwhelming, head up two storeys, to the roof. The owner has laid out a stretch of plastic grass, installed some more black-and-white chairs and tables and strung a series of washing lines across the roof, each with a selection of flat two-tone clothing – shirts, blouses, shorts – hanging from them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">So which part of Seoul are we in?</strong> A 15-minute walk from exit three of Hongik University Station, Yeonnam-Dong is undergoing something of a makeover. The narrow lanes are losing their grimy tradi­tional stores and one-person businesses, and those properties are being taken over by hip cafes run by adventurous individuals such as Lee. Within a few hundred metres are Thai, Brazilian and Vietnamese restaur­ants, sophisticated wine bars, boutiques and music stores that specialise in vinyl – and, of course, have in-store coffee shops.</p><img aria-label=loading data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOramarpWhfKK%2B06KapZ1faH1ygo9ybWibkZuybsXEqKWnmZ1isbC6xmZpa2tdZoFuv8SorKVlk5a%2FtbvOp2StoJWisqU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

So far, we don't know what she's having this time around.&nbsp;Do you think Underwood's baby is a boy, or a girl?</p><p>Underwood married NFL hockey player Mike Fisher on July 10, 2010, and the couple announced that she was <a href=#>pregnant with her first child</a> in September of 2014. <a href=#>Brad Paisley</a> revealed the child was a boy live onstage during the 2014 <a href=#>CMA Awards</a>, and the couple <a href=#>welcomed their son</a>, Isaiah, on Feb. 27, 2015. Underwood turned to social media to reveal her second pregnancy on Wednesday (Aug. 8), coyly giving fans the dates for her <a href=#>2019 Cry Pretty Tour 360</a> before adding, "You might be wondering and asking, 'Carrie, why is your tour starting in May?'" The camera then pulled back to reveal that she was sitting under a balloon that spells out, "Baby."</p><p>Underwood often shares personal glimpses and video of Isaiah and her home life with fans, so it's likely we'll be seeing her document her pregnancy journey and the early years of her second child, too. Are you hoping Isaiah is going to have a little brother? There have been some internet rumors that Underwood might be expecting twins&nbsp;â€” what if she had one of each?</p><p>Weigh in below.</p><p><strong>Relive Carrie's Most Beautiful Pregnancy Pictures</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmip7amedSnm56qp6S8pXnPq5ygppGjwW6uwJuwZpqfrnqwvoygoKukXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The tools for greatness already existed before Wednesday night's (Dec. 1) debut; she wouldn't be there if they didn't. But a&nbsp;plan&nbsp;lacking a brilliant concept, relentless preparation, focused teamwork and attention to every dazzling detail&nbsp;would fall short of transformative.</p><p>And Underwood's show is transformative.</p><p>As she waved&nbsp;from atop a ledge, built into a water wall, which&nbsp;drops back into the expansive stage it rose from prior to her encore, she smiled the smile of a champion and fought to catch her breath. Her band was soaking wet at this point, if not from the sweat of playing, then from the&nbsp;water cascading down on and around them. "Something&nbsp;in the Water" has long been a tour highlight for the three-time Entertainer of the Year, but in Vegas, it's purified, amplified and magnified to leave every hair on your body standing at attention.</p><p>How Team Underwood would&nbsp;build upon the visually spectacular Cry Pretty 360 Tour&nbsp;is central to the anticipation of this show. Throughout Reflection: The Las Vegas Residency,&nbsp;state of the art video screens and a best-in-class audio system&nbsp;are sure to reinvent her as a live performer for those who've only attended arena or festival shows.&nbsp;But this show is more than just a wonder of technology.</p><p>A team of&nbsp;dancing rhythmic gymnasts&nbsp;first join Underwood and her eight-piece band during "Drinking Alone," but they&nbsp;elevate the show with a hoops exposition during "Blown Away," the bookend for her mid-show death trilogy. Pairs&nbsp;weave arms and legs between floor-to-ceiling tapestries and ascend 20 to 30 feet into the air for a synchronized performance equal parts beautiful and harrowing. Every time their toes touch the stage, the bar raises another notch, but none of it&nbsp;distracts from the vocal performance. The music is never lost.</p><p>After what looked like early nerves, Underwood found her breath at the end of "Two Black Cadillacs," holding a note in a way fans selfishly expect her to do on repeat. The rigor of her setlist should not go unappreciated — rangy ballads&nbsp;are followed by more that require even higher, longer runs. There's&nbsp;barely a break for Underwood, though "All-American Girl" may&nbsp;have qualified on this night, as she invited a woman who was celebrating her&nbsp;bachelorette party to the stage to sing along with her. Regina from Las Vegas needed no further encouragement.</p><p>On the&nbsp;residency's opening night, "Cowboy Cassanova" began a set that included 21 song titles. Underwood's entrance is&nbsp;special, but by the time she nonchalantly sets a Jeep on fire to finish "Before He Cheats," the quieter early moments of the show are long forgotten. Most country concerts are built like a good mix tape: Early energy gives way to mid-show ballads and conversation before a rousing&nbsp;rush of hits, covers and pyro, if available. Reflection builds more like the Mountain Climber game on&nbsp;The Price Is Right. Sure, "Jesus Take the Wheel" is a chance to sit down, but then she adds a bit of "How Great Thou Art" to close and you're standing in rapture once again. Only the beer vendor left disappointed, as there's just not a chance you'll want to scoot away for a refill.</p><p>Several outfit changes allow room for Underwood's well-rehearsed band to show off some more. A cover of Led Zeppelin's "Rock and Roll" is an unexpected highlight of&nbsp;this show, which is scheduled through&nbsp;December with dates in March, April and now&nbsp;May 2022. Drummer&nbsp;Elizabeth Chan could change her name to Joan Bonham and no one would object.</p><p>When Underwood returned in a flowing silver skirt and jacket to begin the final few songs, it felt like&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;fourth quarter surge appropriate for a singer as athletic as she is. In tangible ways, everything&nbsp;the country star has done prior to now —&nbsp;her dramatic songwriting, the dynamic touring rigs, her dedication to exercise and fitness — was for this moment.</p><p>The Resorts World&nbsp;Theatre is part of Resorts World Las Vegas, a newly-opened Hilton partnership on the Las Vegas strip. Katy Perry, Celine Dion and <a href=#>Luke Bryan</a> also have residencies scheduled into 2022, but during a tour of the property prior to the show, executives assured Taste of Country and select media that even more&nbsp;experiences will&nbsp;be announced soon.</p><p>Taste of Country was brought to witness Reflection: The Las Vegas Residency as a guest of Resorts World Las Vegas.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Carrie Underwood Reflection: The Las Vegas Residency Pictures</h2><p>Carrie Underwood kicked off her Reflection: The Las Vegas Residency on Wednesday, Dec. 1.

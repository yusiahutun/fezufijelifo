Hong Kong has a rich variety of native orchids – 133 known species, in fact – and spring, with its combination of high rainfall and humidity, produces the ideal damp environment for them to thrive.
To celebrate orchids, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden (KFBG), in Tai Po in the city’s New Territories, is hosting a festival, “Nature Exploration – Orchid Encounters”, on April 25 that includes a tour of its facilities that house local orchids and orchids from the India-Myanmar region, as well as a workshop on repotting that will outline how to care for orchids. <a href=../../../../why-orchids-are-so-loved-festival-hong-kong-celebrates-flowers-beauty-and-shows-how-raise-them-home.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../experts-say-reason-shouldnt-smile-mugshot-arrested-html.html>Experts say THIS is the reason you shouldn't smile in your mugshot if you are arrested</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Narimon Pishnamaz, partner at injury trial law firm Law & Pish, based in California, used the example of&nbsp;Angenette Marie Missett to make his point, who famously smiled in her mugshot&nbsp;before being sentenced to 11 years in prison for killing a mother of three in a car crash.&nbsp;
In the clip posted on YouTube under his moniker&nbsp;@AttorneyPish, he asks viewers to imagine if they smiled in a mugshot which was then presented to a jury, who were asked if the person looks remorseful. <a href=../../../../experts-say-reason-shouldnt-smile-mugshot-arrested-html.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../melrose-place-amy-locane-sentenced-fatal-dui-case.html>Melrose Place Star Amy Locane To Be Sentenced For Fourth Time in Fatal DUI Case</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

"Melrose Place" veteran Amy Locane will be sentenced a fourth time for her fatal DUI crash, according to judges presiding over the case.
In 2010, Locane, 48, killed Helene Seeman and critically wounded her husband, Fred, in an automobile collision outside the couple's New Jersey home.
On Wednesday, a New Jersey court ruled that a judge had incorrectly sentenced Locane in 2019 and the case would go back to court for another round of sentencing. <a href=../../../../melrose-place-amy-locane-sentenced-fatal-dui-case.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../../categories/blog/page/220/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>

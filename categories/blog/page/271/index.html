Kristen DePasquale, 27, was arrested on Monday on counts of first-degree murder and child neglect with great bodily harm after investigators with the Oviedo Police Department said they found inconsistencies in her version of events.
At around 10pm last Thursday, police responded to DePasquale's home on Covington Street in Oviedo after getting a report of a child in cardiac arrest with something wrapped around her neck. <a href=../../../../mother-two-27-accused-strangling-one-year-old-daughter-halloween-lights-blaming-son-two-baby-sister-s-death-html.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../../categories/blog/page/270/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>

Today, her sister Claudette is assuring fans that she couldn't have been more true to her word.</p><p id=eg1jHlHMHjy data-wc=14>"She's doing everything to recover," Claudette, 74, tells HELLO! Canada. "She's a strong woman."</p><p id=e5HsUIkLzSn data-wc=44>Claudette, a recording star in her own right, graciously took the time to speak to HELLO! Canada to share a hopeful update about her superstar sibling – and goddaughter – and offer insight into the Grammy winner's battle with the rare and debilitating condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb698481ce00-helo886-887cover.jpg><p id=efWqgRV7Ye0 data-wc=70>"It's an illness we know so little about," admits Claudette, candidly reflecting on symptoms linked to the syndrome. "There are spasms – they're impossible to control. You know who people often jump up in the night because of a cramp in the leg or the calf? It's a bit like that, but in all muscles," she says, dismayed. "There's little we can do to support her, to alleviate her pain."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=evZtu-pifA0 data-wc=51>Celine, 55, first broke news of her diagnosis <a class=hm-link href=#>in an emotional video on social media,&nbsp;</a>telling fans that she was experiencing spasms affecting "every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I'm used to."</p><p id=eutg5f3QIDS data-wc=69>Since then, the mother of three boys (René-Charles, 22, and twins Nelson and Eddy, 12) <a class=hm-link href=#>has cancelled plans for concerts</a> – putting her Courage world tour on hold "until I'm really ready to be back on stage again" – and has been out of the public eye. Based in Las Vegas, she's been relying on "a great team of doctors" and a sports-medicine therapist to build back her strength.</p><p id=e4oRzyg6jOI data-wc=116>Of course, the "Because You Loved Me" singer – youngest of the 14 Dion children – has also been buoyed by the love of her family, including sister Linda, and her husband, fellow Las Vegas residents. "It's comforting for us all [to have them near Celine]," says Claudette, whose own life as a performer (as well as CEO and spokesperson for La Fondation Maman Dion, an organization founded by her mom that supports disadvantaged youth, and spokesperson for palliative-care centre Maison Adhémar-Dion, named after her late dad) keeps her close to home in Quebec. Though, even across the miles, her bond with Celine has always been special, with a shared interest in music, motherhood and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/19db8983f0c7-dionfamsings.jpg><p id=ewLKYtodrXZ data-wc=26>Ultimately, says Claudette, "we're crossing our fingers that researchers will find a remedy for this awful illness." And she knows fans feel the same way, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d08fcb297702-dionfamilyenmass.jpg><p id=eQDTOKiirgm data-wc=33>"They love Celine," she says proudly, "not only for the voice she has, but also for the human being she is.

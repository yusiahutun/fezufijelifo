class=mol-para-with-font>'Getting it certified or asking for a certificate of authenticity is good practice, especially before purchasing,' the expert continued.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'A

class=mol-para-with-font>'Even some years, the serial numbers can differ fonts, 1s in Serif or San Serif font,' Erkel said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you do come across this serial number on your vintage or pre-loved bag journey, you should be taking extra steps to make sure that you're not purchasing a counterfeit, according to the experts.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This

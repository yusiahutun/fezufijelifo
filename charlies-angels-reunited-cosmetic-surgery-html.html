California sun and fair skin don't go very well together in the long term.</p><p>'The evidence of that is more lines around the lower eyes, crepe-ier skin and even the top lip has more lines than the other two. That explains why she has had work done a little earlier than the others.</p><p>'Farah has had a nose job, eyelid surgery, a facelift and a necklift. Unfortunately, there is only so much you can do about that crepeyness she has naturally in her skin. But nothing seems to be sagging - or hanging, or worse still falling off.'</p><p>Karidis said of Miss Jackson: 'Kate Jackson is not looking too bad at all. She has fairly almond shaped eyes in the younger pictures, so I think she has a slight tilt put in them in recent years.</p><p>'Her eyebrow position seems okay. I think she looks slightly startled here maybe because of the flashbulbs rather than a brow lift. Brow lifts can give that slightly scary look with the eyebrows being higher up - that real Jack Nicholson look. She looks to have had some work around the eyes to take away some of the skin which you would expect to accumulate over the years.'</p><p>On Miss Smith, he said: 'Jaclyn Smith is really looking very good. She always had the benefit of high cheek bones which bodes very well for her. It's like a coat hanger in a coat - it holds up everything.</p><p>'If you have a good bone structure underneath then the skin and bone sit nicely and you age better. That has helped her out quite a bit. I would say she has had a little bit of work done to that jawline to keep it that way. She has had a bit of Botox around the laughter lines.'</p><p>All the Angels have had the same basic level of surgical maintenance, said Karidis.</p><p>'All of the girls have had injectable fillers to get rid of the natural nose to mouth line, though Kate Jackson is smiling so you cannot tell in her case, and perhaps Botox on their foreheads.</p><p>'I would say that the sun damage they have had over the years would have led to the need for some kind of chemical peel or lazer skin peels to resurface and smooth over the skin.</p><p>'In all three of them the jawline is looking very very sharp indeed. At their age I would think they would probably have had some work done to get that appearance. I would suspect that is the case - you can't get that look without having surgery.</p><p>'But they all look pretty good. I would say that's testament to the recent work they have all had done. They don't look scary, they don't look weird in any way.'</p><p>Cosmetic surgeon Dr Lucy Glancey agreed with Karidis's findings, and speaking of Miss Fawcett added: 'Topping-up operations are a lot more complicated than work carried out for the first time due to the presence of scarring and tissues stuck together. This means that Farrah's latest surgery probably would have cost her around Â£20,000. Two years ago it looked as if her injected fillers had gone wrong but today she looks a lot better because fillers fade naturally over time, allowing her to avoid having any corrective surgery.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmtpamZngHCPx5qppaGVqHqCusaeo6xloprCr7XTnptmZZOkwK6x06KaZqulp7Smvthnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China remains Gap’s largest business segment in Asia, but it has also decreased its stores in North America from 1,111 in 2010 to 520 in 2021, when it had 329 stores in Asia, according to data from Statista.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to its first-quarter earnings report, GAP Group’s sales fell by 13 per cent year on year to US$3.5 billion, taking net losses to US$162 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Foreign brands are, according to Ma, struggling to compete with domestic brands who leverage large social media followings to offer cheaper products at lower prices via live-streaming and e-commerce platforms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Chinese e-commerce users can buy clothing products for less than 50 yuan (US$7.3), and buy two and three pieces and also get free shipping,” he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This low-price model via Chinese e-commerce platforms is ideal for Chinese

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Data from iiMedia Research showed that 62 per cent of Chinese consumers will buy clothes via e-commerce platforms in 2022, while 58.5 per cent of all customers spend between 201 and 600 yuan on making clothing purchases via traditional offline and online platforms combined.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“However, the price of brands such as Gap and Zara are concentrated in the 300-600 yuan range, which cannot compete with local, inexpensive brands,” Ma added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rise of nationalism is also stimulating the apparel industry to adopt more Chinese elements, with “being a Chinese brand” and “having Chinese elements” top considerations for young Chinese consumers, according to the “China Youth Consumption Report” from iiMedia Research.</p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2

exacerbated the trend, with Baidu’s 2021 big-data search report showing that the search volume of Chinese clothing brands increased by 137 per cent after the moves due to concerns over human rights,

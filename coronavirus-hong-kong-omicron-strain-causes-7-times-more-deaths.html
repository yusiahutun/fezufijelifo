A total of eight fatalities were recorded among youngsters during the fifth wave, according to the Hospital Authority.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the four analysed deaths, the youngest was an 11-month-old girl, who was previously diagnosed with Covid-19 alongside six other family members, including her twin sister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/01/e1f351ae-d42a-4833-b47e-a666b3859591_e04730f7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report also recorded the deaths of two toddlers, a three-year-old girl and a four-year-old boy, and found the pair had died from conditions that affected their brains. Both cases had been sent to the coroner for further examination.</p><p>“Why [Hong Kong] children under five years old infected with Omicron seem to have such unexpected severity could be due to the lack of exposure to seasonal human coronaviruses in the past two years, resulting in a lack of cross-reactive immunity,” the report said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Professor Kwan said the bodily harm caused by Omicron BA.2 was unlike that of previous Covid-19 variants reported in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have seen seizures that lasted up to 30 minutes, swollen vocal cords, changes in consciousness and acute brain inflammation. All these are unique to this Omicron sub-variant,” he said. “It is particularly worrying because seizures lasting that long might lead to brain hypoxia.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwan said that researchers were particularly worried about children contracting the sub-variant, with the strain capable of causing “severe damage to their central nervous system and respiratory system”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Children should get vaccinated. Research has shown that two jabs of the BioNTech vaccine or three jabs of the Sinovac vaccine can already provide sufficient immunity against Omicron,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Baby’s first word after ‘Mama’ was ‘mask’: giving birth in the pandemic</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dr Agnes Leung Sze-yin, an assistant professor of paediatrics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, called the research “valuable”, with the paper being one of the first to study Omicron BA.2.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It retains the original Omicron variant’s transmissibility, but we can see from this paper that it seems as potent as Delta,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Leung said the study was a warning of the effects the sub-variant could have on a patient’s neurons, in addition to causing “abnormalities within brain cells”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dr Sara Ho Yuen-ha, a chief manager at the Hospital Authority, urged parents to get their children vaccinated against the coronavirus as soon as possible.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She also called on pregnant women to get vaccinated as newborns could gain immunity against Covid-19 for up to six months after birth if their mothers were inoculated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Thursday, about 60 per cent of children aged between three and 11 had received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while only one in five of the age group had been fully inoculated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuSam5rbmNofKS70ailmq6Zp8K0eceopaBlm6S7qHnOpqCcqp%2BjerTA0Zqgp2WTlsK0sdJmbmasmaKytHnMqKmeZZSarrW00g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

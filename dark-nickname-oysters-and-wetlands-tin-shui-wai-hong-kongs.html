The arrests sparked tensions and hundreds besieged the local police station.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/06/5e557b2e-cfc4-11e9-9cec-db56b3c139e7_1320x770_153950.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Confrontations between protest supporters and police lasted till the small hours of July 31, when the crowd was suddenly hit by several fireworks thrown out of a passing car with fake number plates. Six people were injured in the incident.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, Tin Shui Wai Police Station has become a flashpoint of recurring chaos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/06/33c483de-cfc2-11e9-9cec-db56b3c139e7_1320x770_153950.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another round of severe clashes erupted when protesters gathered at the police station around noon on August 5. Some threw rocks at officers, who responded with rounds of tear gas and 82 arrests.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nine days later, three more protesters were detained after a crowd burned incense, clothes and joss paper on the evening of the Hungry Ghost Festival.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/06/c17127a8-cfc4-11e9-9cec-db56b3c139e7_1320x770_153950.JPEG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wan, who lives far from the police station, says she is concerned about residents’ safety.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are some primary and secondary schools nearby.

Canto-pop star Hacken Lee Hak-kan also had a song about Tin Shui Wai, depicting the struggle of a new immigrant.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the recent protests have brought with them rampant anti-mainland Chinese sentiment, many immigrants in the neighbourhood have found themselves in a dilemma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/06/d810c5ca-cfc1-11e9-9cec-db56b3c139e7_1320x770_153950.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fisher, 20, started attending a high school in Tin Shui Wai after he moved from Shenzhen in 2016.

Tin Shui Wai workers earned an average of HK$13,430 monthly, compared with an average of HK$15,000 for Hong Kong as a whole.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The population was relatively young, with more than 46,000 residents registered as students in 2016 and the town’s median age was 42.4, lower than the city average of 44.3.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s a vibrant neighbourhood. You see streets and parks full of young people and kids, so it’s easy to tell that the ageing issue is not that serious here,” Wan says, adding she feels the label of sadness attached to the town has long faded.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Tin Shui Wai residents left fearing for safety amid illegally dumped waste</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Underdeveloped land</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the other hand, Wan admits Tin Shui Wai lacks large shopping malls and convenient transport.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If my friends and I want to hang out and have fun, we normally go to Tuen Mun or Tsuen Wan, ” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although locals may desire more public facilities and businesses, the situation of underdevelopment faced by the town is rooted in history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/06/12980780-cfc2-11e9-9cec-db56b3c139e7_1320x770_153950.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tin Shui, meaning “water from the sky” in Cantonese, is named after the ancestral shrine of the Chiu clan from Guangdong, which acquired a lease of land from the British colonial government in 1916. Before that, the area was largely covered with swamps and mud flats, with a few villagers who nurtured oysters living there.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a bid to develop agriculture, the Chiu family hired workers to transform part of the soft ground into cropland and ponds, building dykes to stop flooding.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such farmland is called gei wai, which is where the name Tin Shui Wai comes from.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the 20th century, disputes raged about the area’s ownership among renowned local families, companies and the authorities. In 1982, the government bought all the land for HK$2.258 billion from Mightycity Company, then a major developer in Tin Shui Wai, now partly owned by Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong (Holdings).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/06/2f5fff7c-cfc6-11e9-9cec-db56b3c139e7_1320x770_153950.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Post reported in 2010 that under a private memorandum signed between the colonial British government and Mightycity, commercial developments in government buildings are not allowed to compete with private shops in any way that would damage the company’s viability.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is suspected this agreement prevented authorities from building anything but small local-style businesses, shops and markets, along with densely located public housing estates, during the early years of Tin Shui Wai’s development.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The town was chosen in the 1980s as the third generation of “New Town”, a government project aiming to increase prosperity in the New Territories to disperse the booming populations in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What are the local charms?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The town preserves a large area of wetland in the Inner Deep Bay, recognised as one of the world’s 2,300 vital wetland sites under the 1995 Ramsar Convention. It is home to some of Hong Kong’s unique wildlife, including the endangered black-faced spoonbill, as well as butterflies, amphibians and reptiles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/06/58ce4580-cfc1-11e9-9cec-db56b3c139e7_1320x770_153950.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tourists can also visit a historical site called Tsui Sing Lau Pagoda, built more than 600 years ago by the famed Tang clan in the New Territories. The monument is part of the Ping Shan Heritage Trail in Yuen Long district.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For those planning for a culinary tour, Wa So Cafe, a popular restaurant chain celebrated by local stars such as Chow Yun-fat and Shawn Yue Man-lok, opened its first branch in Tin Shui Wai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Fisher, who graduated from high school just months earlier, the place he misses most is a long riverbank that expands from the wetland park, where he used to jog after class at night.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are people taking a walk, the elderly playing erhu and listening to the radio in Mandarin, and you can smell dog excrement along the road.

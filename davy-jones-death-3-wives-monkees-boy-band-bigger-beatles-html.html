They tied the knot in 1968 – at the peak of his fame – when she was pregnant with daughter Talia. They had another daughter, Sarah.</span></p><p><span>He admits that he missed countless birthday parties and other milestones, saying: 'I didn't know how to be a partner.

'Mike was smart and got all the B-sides. When we checked into the Grosvenor House hotel in London, Mike booked a whole floor; the rest of us had single rooms.'</span></p><p><span>In another interview he said: 'I wish I'd made more money, I wish I'd made millions or even a million.'

With the win, she cemented her spot on the pantheon of all-time basketball greats.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The talk of her decorated career, both as a coach and player, runs endlessly, but what about her relationships with her husband? Is she happily married to her husband? Or is she - like the rumors claim - a lesbian? Could she be single? Read along to learn more, including her parents & age!</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Dawn Staley Lesbian?</h2><p>Dawn has always kept her love life secret. She is not married and has not revealed anything about having a partner. There are speculations about having a wife instead of a husband.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Discover</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Where Is Jaye Davidson Now & What Is His Net Worth Now? Model Update</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Although she has never taken offense to being labeled as a lesbian by her&nbsp;fans, the former Houston Comtes guard, age 51,&nbsp;hasn't spoken on the very matter.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, there are rumors of Dawn and Lisa Boyer getting together.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Is Lisa Boyer Married To Dawn Staley?</h2><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-191 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Refraining to shed light on neither her sexuality nor her relationships in interviews, Dawn has opted for more of a passive-aggressive approach on Twitter when it comes to divulging her thoughts on being married and husband material.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The Philly native once jokingly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">called</a>&nbsp;a Twitter user(@ksan_indiangirl) her husband. The tweet, which dates back to 2009, reads:-</p><p style=text-align:justify>"@<strong>ksan_indiangirl</strong> keep the house clean & me well feed....we can call u my domestic husband. :)"</p><p style=text-align:justify>Nine years later, Dawn&nbsp;once again lit up her Twitter feed by tapping into her sarcastic pit as she likened her relationship with her assistant at USC, Lisa Boyer, to that of a married couple.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Interesting</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Lindsey Vonn Delivers Retirement Letter; At Age 34, She's Done - Why?</a></p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-192 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Dawn Staley is cheeking drop thoughts on being married to a wife (Photo:- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>Although sarcastic, the tweet didn't go well with the fans as they opted for it to be true. Many thought that she was married to a wife. Moreover, Lisa's reply held everyone to believe that they might be partners.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But ironically, that's Dawn, witty and full of sarcasm.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>All in all, the South Carolina Gamecocks head coach could be single at this very moment and does not have a husband.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Even though she has not confirmed being a lesbian, she does support the LGBTQ+ community.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Embracing LGBTQ Community: Lauded By Lesbian Assistant For Embracing Her Partner</h2><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-193 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>For Dawn, who has never identified herself as a lesbian, the LGBTQ community has welcomed her with open arms.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read Also</strong>:-&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Glory Johnson Ends Her Married Life With Her Lesbian Partner, Meet Her New Boyfriend</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Suffice to say that the feeling&nbsp;of admiration is mutual.

I think the WNBA will embrace any group that embraces their organization."</p><p style=text-align:justify>So when her openly lesbian assistant at the USC, Melanie Balcomb, came forth with the story of how Dawn had embraced both her partner and their kids in the 2017&nbsp;New York Times interview, nobody acted surprised. Melanie revealed:-</p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;“We haven’t been welcomed everywhere, and Dawn welcomed me and my family. It’s been an unbelievable experience.”</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-194 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>In 2018, Dawn - whose parents were initially from South Carolina - created headlines for a different reason. In February, she and Missouri athletics director Jim Strek settled her defamation lawsuit.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Besides her personal life, she has been doing amazing in her career.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Dawn Staley's Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Dawn has bagged numerous awards under her belt as a player and a coach.

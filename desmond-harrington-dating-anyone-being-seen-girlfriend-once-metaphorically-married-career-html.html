He has a lot of hearts beating for him but does his heart beat for anyone?</p><p>People can have multiple relationships in their life and we know that Desmond was previously seen with his past girlfriend, but is he dating someone after her? What does the love life of this handsome hunk look like? Does he have a girl in his life as of now or is he just a single man looking to make more name in his professional life? Let us find out!&nbsp;<span style=color:red>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>What Happened To His Relationship With His Past Girlfriend?&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Dating Anyone Lately?</h2><p>It was 2012; Desmond was seen and spotted at various places with the gorgeous and famous <a href=# rel=follow>actress Amanda Seyfried</a>. The two began dating back in July 2012, and they were head-over-heels in love with one another as the two were frequently seen together in public. Desmond was famously seen <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">leaving Amanda's hous</a>e in late July 2012. A source described that they were trying their best to avoid the public eye. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>'They were definitely trying not to be seen,'</p><p>&nbsp;'Desmond even kept his baseball cap on and the group picked an out of the way table to enjoy some drinks and dinner.'</p><p>Furthermore, the two were also seen taking a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">romantic stroll past NY</a>&nbsp;in August 2012, and the hand in hand walk showed their love for each other.</p><p><img alt height=623 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/article-0-14B6BB2C000005DC-7_468x623.jpg width=468 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Caption: Desmond and Amanda take a romantic stroll past in NY. (August 2012)</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: dailymail.co.uk</p><p>The two were then spotted on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">streets of NY </a>on a sidewalk to have coffee. Instead of getting a table or leaning against a wall, the two opted to sit on the floor.</p><p><img alt height=459 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/article-0-158E742B000005DC-178_634x485.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Caption: Amanda Seyfried and Desmond enjoying their coffee in the streets of NY. (October 2012)</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: dailymail.co.uk</p><p>The two apparently had developed ample love with one another in a short span of dating.</p><p>But fate had something not so good in store for their relationship, and following some undisclosed reason, the two broke up in&nbsp;April 2013. The two chose not to reveal anything about the demise of their relationship to the media, leaving the reason for their&nbsp;relationship demise to remain a mystery. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>As of now, <a href=# rel=follow>Amanda Seyfried is in a happy relationship with actor Thomas Sadoski, and the two also have a daughter in their life.</a>&nbsp;But what about Desmond? Has he been dating anyone lately?</p><p>Well, he is said to be dating Gabbie Hanna, but the two have not revealed much about the nature of their relationship which is why we might need to wait for the actor to come forth and affirm the reports. He has also not revealed if he is married and has a wife.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Maybe, he just wants fans and media to focus on his professional life. But one thing is for sure, having dated Amanda in the past, he is certainly not a gay.</p><h2>Desmond's Weight Loss:</h2><p>Ever since he started looking slimmer in season 5 of Dexter, people often speculated if he was embracing drugs or had fallen sick.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caption: Desmond Harrington during season 1 (L) and season 5 (R) of Dexter.&nbsp;</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Photo Credit: uproxx.com</p><p>But the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">actor revealed</a> that he was running and eating better.</p><p>In his words, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>" I did not have any plastic surgery, I'm not sick it's called running and eating better! You understand? I'm in my 30s now. All these ridiculous stuff that I read "He's sick, he's on drugs", get a life! I just changed how I ate and begin to run!"</p><p>There goes all the drug and sickness rumor.</p><p>Regardless, he is a treat to have on our TV screens, and we hope&nbsp;that he delivers even more in the coming days.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><a href=# rel=follow>Stay with us</a> for latest updates on Desmond Harrington!</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZp2do6K8r7CMoZirqpmjtLW7zWabmqyZo7Rurc2ypqedXZeyqrrGZqqenZ5itKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqwusKeZKadpJa9qbvRopqapJyueq6t0augnpxdmK6zscSrZaGsnaE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

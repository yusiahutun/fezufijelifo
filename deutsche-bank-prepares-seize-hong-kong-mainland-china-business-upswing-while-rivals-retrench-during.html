Bank of America in January announced around 20 job cuts in Asia, mainly affecting Hong Kong-based bankers and those who work on China deals.</p>First-time stock offerings in China’s main stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">tumbled in the first quarter</span></a>, drying up advisory fees for investment banks. Several potential jumbo offerings from Syngenta and units of Alibaba Group Holding have since been canned or scrapped.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sooner or later, businesses in mainland China will rebound and Deutsche Bank wants to position itself to seize the moment, said von zur Muehlen, who is based in Singapore.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong bankers have lots of free time, anxiety as deals slump, lay-offs jump</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Deutsche Bank had 851 full-time staff in Hong Kong last year, versus 844 in 2021, according to its annual report. In mainland China, its headcount rose to 634 in 2023 from 553 in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both markets, however, showed contrasting performance over those two pandemic years. Profit before tax fell to 74 million euros (US$78.7 million) from 121 million euros in Hong Kong. In mainland China, its profit surged to 131 million euros from 89 million euros.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">von zur Muehlen emphasised the significance of its 152-year history of doing business in China, particularly in times of geopolitical uncertainty, adding that one should not get distracted by some issues that markets are facing at the moment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There will always be a need for capital, as China continues to open up and pushes for a wider international usage of the yuan, he added. This creates an opportunity for Deutsche Bank to facilitate more cross-border activity from Hong Kong.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/01/18/Thumbnail---Clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">05:03</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Paul Chan woos Middle East companies to visit Hong Kong in 2023 to explore listing opportunities</p><p>Paul Chan woos Middle East companies to visit Hong Kong in 2023 to explore listing opportunities</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong has a unique position, it is the financial window to the world for China, both for inbound and outbound,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China last month set its growth target for 2024 at about 5 per cent, after the economy accelerated 5.2 per cent in 2023 from 3 per cent in the preceding year. Despite setbacks from weak consumption and high savings rates, there are also many booming areas within the economy, he noted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Top sectors that are attractive to investors include electric vehicles, renewables, technology and innovation. China’s weaker currency at present benefits export-oriented industries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We all need to start understanding and live with the fact that China is not going to grow at the 9 or 10 per cent rate that we’ve had for decades before,” he said. “There are numerous countries in the world that would be thrilled to achieve 5 per cent growth.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Deutsche Bank is positive on the outlook for inbound investments from the Middle East to China, particularly from sovereign funds in that region, said von zur Muehlen, who was also tasked with overseeing Germany and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region since last year.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why people are at the heart of Deutsche Bank’s success in China and Asia-Pacific</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Deutsche Bank expects more transactions between China and the Middle East and added the pipeline was growing. Middle Eastern investors are striving for diversification. They view China as a very strong and still rising economy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bank recently was one of the advisers on a record-breaking US$8.6 billion deal led by private equity firm PAG and Chinese property giant Dalian Wanda’s mall unit. It was the largest direct inbound investment from the Middle East to date.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’ve seen a lot of assets being repriced lower, whereas many stock markets in the western hemisphere are trading at all-time highs,” he said. “This is when the [Hong Kong] market starts getting attractive.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For investments to go from the pipeline to solid transaction, they will require a time period of “stability and calmness politically, economically, and tendencies around property markets, not just in China”, he said. Then, assets in both Hong Kong and mainland China will appeal to investors, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China will come back and we are here for the long game,” he said. “I’ve never been worried about Hong Kong to begin with,” von zur Muehlen said. “People always talk negatively, [but] there’s no reason. Businesses can always be better. The last few years have been very quiet. But we’re seeing good signs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfl66vt8innmaemaOur6%2FEaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtscXBmanylsdStqpyglWKvorrKZqernaCWv6a%2FjKycorKVYrWwusZmoqiml2K6orXNpZinnF2Ytaq6wGaZrquZo7K0v4yup6yvmaO0bsPHoqOeZaKew6K40mapnqyimruktIydrKuhnpw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

With the dwindling influence of radio replaced with self-curated streaming and the indisputable impact of TikTok, what may be a popular—or even simply a good song—may differ depending on what your "For You" feed looks like.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Doechii has never been an artist worried about mainstream impact, and if anything, her willingness to creatively experiment, especially via her music, has become a crucial component to her authentic rise as a new voice in hip-hop. At a time where specifically female Southern Black acts continue to dominate (Megan Thee Stallion, GloRilla, and Latto for example), she's shied away from defining herself by genre constraints. She's a woman in hip-hop, yes. But how far can she stretch what that really means?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her latest single, 'What It Is (Block Boy)', is a superb example of an artist flirting with mainstream notoriety without abandoning their roots. The infectious track samples two gems within the Black music canon: TLC's 1999 hit "No Scrubs" and 2004's "Some Cut" by Lil Scrappy and Trillville while she floats above the beat with an ear-worm of a chorus.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What it is, ho? What's up?<br>Every good girl needs a little thug<br>Every block boy needs a little love<br>If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“This song is a fusion of nostalgia and pop vibes,” Doechii said in a statement at the time of the song's release. “I feel like I’m showing off a side of my vocal range with this one that my fans haven’t really seen yet. I love using [the older samples] to mix in some playful energy as well."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the samples are recognizable, they're not lazily executed, and while the lyrics are memorable, they're not vapid. The track's accompanying video (featuring the song's collaborator and fellow Floridian Kodak Black) evokes another sense of nostalgia as well, echoing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl5t3TyP8aY" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Beyoncé and Jay Z's early aughts collaboration" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Beyoncé and Jay Z's early aughts collaboration</a> '03 Bonnie and Clyde'. An additional <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/SUCKAW0RLD/status/1636844287815036929 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mid-video dance break" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">mid-video dance break</a> brings to mind Britney Spears at her prime or Aaliyah's eternally immortalized swagger as well. Instead of carbon copying early millennium acts however, Doechii takes her influences and makes it her own. She's acutely aware there won't ever be another Aaliyah or Janet or Lauryn—but she can be Doechii.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Much like how "Say So" and "Starships" changed the game for Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj, Doechii's foray into a pop space will definitely pose fruitful. Her authenticity to herself and to the region that raised her however, is what will ensure she's a lasting act.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I hope that me, my art, and my music and the Doechii experience inspire somebody to be themselves or just be more free," she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a41603700/doechii-spotify-radar-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="previously told BAZAAR " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">previously told BAZAAR </a>of the music that's to come. "That's why I have to be free and I have to be a weird rockstar so that you can feel more comfortable to be a weird rockstar too."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.

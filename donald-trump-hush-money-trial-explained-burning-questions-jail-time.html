While paying hush money is not necessarily illegal, as it was allegedly intended to hide salacious details from voters – particularly after the infamous tape – the payments therefore violated campaign finance law.</p><p id=e9f6vro3Ras data-wc=62>Daniels and Trump allegedly <strong>had a one-time affair in 2006 in a Nevada hotel room</strong>, one year after he married current, third wife <a class=hm-link href=#>Melania Trump</a>, née Knauss. Daniels was paid $130,000 by Trump's former fixer <strong>Michael Cohen</strong> to sign a nondisclosure agreement about the relationship with Trump, which Trump reimbursed, however he has maintained his innocence and that the payments were unrelated.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Former President Donald Trump charged with 34 counts during arrest – details" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5c5210471add-gettyimages-1479519261.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Former President Donald Trump charged with 34 counts during arrest – details" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Former President Donald Trump charged with 34 counts during arrest – details</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=en47tDmAB_l data-wc=51>While in New York falsifying business records is usually a misdemeanor punishable by no more than one year in prison, it becomes a felony punishable by up to four years in prison when done in order to either exacerbate or conceal a previous crime, in this case the campaign finance violation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/029b8452bbd7-gettyimages-1480134960.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Could Trump actually go to jail?</strong></h2><p id=eU2v2-Dkzy1 data-wc=51><strong>Technically, yes, but it depends.</strong> Though the maximum penalty for each of the 34 counts is four years, <strong>New York has a 20-year cap on sentencing for such felonies,</strong> and it is up to the judge, should Trump be sentenced to prison time, whether he would serve them concurrently or consecutively.</p><p id=ePKL6Dsdh4c data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jeffrey Epstein documents unsealed: why were they released and what happens next</a></p><p id=esm-Nf38LVW data-wc=34>Per <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>CNN</a>, because the nature of the crimes isn't violent and he doesn't have a criminal record, the judge could also decide to jail him for significantly less than what the maximum sentence is.</p><p id=e3CyIyrbR86J data-wc=31>Or, he could avoid prison time completely, and be on probation instead, but with the chance of going to jail always a possibility should he violate conditions set by the judge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/370952e5dad8-gettyimages-2006238807.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Where to watch Trump's trial?</strong></h2><p id=eanoCUKUd2du data-wc=51>Trump has to be in court every day for the duration of the trial, however don't expect to be tuning in to court TV yourself day after day, <strong>as the trial won't be televised</strong>.

Grain of salt. But 1) these are just the latest in a LONG string of people alleging similar things, and 2) <a href=#>Rielle Hunter</a>.</p><p>Joan Edwards was Travolta’s secretary from 1978-1994 and is the first ex-employee to publicly say the actor is gay – a surprisingly common revelation of late.&nbsp;</p><p>“I did everything for him, including taking care of his personal and professional schedules. Of course I knew he was gay. It never bothered me,” she said.</p><p>Carrie Fisher has also said <a href=#>John Travolta is gay</a>. Edwards says specifically, she knew of Travolta’s affair with Gotterba, who began working for him in 1981.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s how I met Doug. We both worked for John at the same time. Doug is a wonderful guy and we are still good friends,” she told the <a href=#>celebrity news</a> mag.</p><p>“He told me that John was gay and they had a sexual relationship,” she said.</p><p>Doug Gotterba is not quoted by the Enquirer about his relationship with Travolta. The tabloid says only that he confirmed his employment with the actor.</p><p>But Gotterba’s post-Travolta boyfriend, Robert Britz, confirms that and more.</p><p>“Doug told me right at the beginning of our relationship that he’d had a homosexual relationship with John Travolta in the 1980s,” Britz recalled.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span><p>“Doug said John was constantly <a href=# rel=noopener>grabbing at his genital area</a>, but he put up with John’s sexual advances because working for him was ‘lucrative.’”</p><p>Britz also reveals that he was shown home video of Gotterba and Travolta in a hotel room.</p><p>“I personally saw about two minutes of Doug’s video showing John Travolta at the end of a bed with his shirt off. There were plates of food in front of him.”</p><p>“The video appeared to be shot in a hotel room. Doug said it was lucrative to be what he called John’s ‘personal right hand man’ and homosexual partner.”</p><p>But Britz says Gotterba told him the relationship with Travolta was too much and he was turned off by John’s “hairy body” and weight gain between movies.</p><p>“After a few years, Doug grew apart from John sexually, and John’s advances started to repulse him,” Britz said. “The relationship ended shortly thereafter.”</p><p>And while Travolta was peaking in his Hollywood stardom, author Wensley Clarkson claims his team scrambled to hide his rumored homosexuality.</p><p>By setting him up on a date with 16-year-old starlet Brooke Shields.</p><p>“The relationship reached a head when John was being interviewed by a journalist and just happened to take two lovey-dovey phone calls from Brooke during the interview,” Clarkson wrote in his 1997 biography John Travolta: Back in Character.</p><p>“Close friends of John Travolta knew perfectly well there was no romance with Brooke. But the rumors certainly helped to improve John’s image.”</p><p>John married Kelly Preston in 1991 and is fighting two <a href=#>lawsuits from masseurs</a> who claim he became sexually aggressive with them during massages.</p><p style=text-align:left><strong>What do you think?

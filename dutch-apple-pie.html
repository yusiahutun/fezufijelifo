There seems to be a divide wherein American home cooking sites largely refer to a Dutch apple pie as a deep-dish apple pie (sometimes, but not always, in a cake pan) with a crumb topping and Dutch (or Dutch-sounding; I do not speak the language** so am making an educated guess) cooks use a more cookie-like dough that’s cross-crossed on top with a shiny finish. Fortunately, around this time I remembered that one of my son’s good friend’s mom is Dutch and she was happy to set me on the right course: yes the lattice is shiny, the dough is sweet and more buttery tasting than its American counterpart, the end result looks more like a cake, and please remember to send all samples over.</p><p><span id=more-34530></span></p><p><a title="butter into flour and sugar" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4596/25331475918_1c187b99d4_n.jpg alt="butter into flour and sugar" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="add the egg" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4691/38320822285_0a3cdfda9d_n.jpg alt="add the egg" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="kneaded together" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4633/39197113631_3686936ff4_n.jpg alt="kneaded together" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="wrap and chill the dough" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4680/38320822005_09b92feb9e_n.jpg alt="wrap and chill the dough" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="divide the dough roughly into thirds" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4684/24336127937_434f8fdf12_n.jpg alt="divide the dough roughly into thirds" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="cut a circle for the base" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4686/24336127387_910b3be581_n.jpg alt="cut a circle for the base" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="lining the springform with crust" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4587/24336126917_0af092c256_n.jpg alt="lining the springform with crust" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="lined crust" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4693/24336126357_b7c620f8d1_n.jpg alt="lined crust" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>From there, I was off to the races… sort of. First I had to watch a lot of <a href=#>videos</a> of home cooks making it and, as no two recipes precisely agreed, basically just throw my hands in the air and hope I could work it out in the kitchen. It does not always happen — figuring things out on an early go — but this time it did. I hope this is a good omen for the year to come, as my cooking wish list for 2018 could fill five calendars, and for you too: this is much, much easier than it looks.</p><p><a title="peeling apples" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4640/38320845595_cf72468899_n.jpg alt="peeling apples" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="sliced apples" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4597/24336128327_d2dfd47845_n.jpg alt="sliced apples" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="sugar and cinnamon" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4645/24336125357_ef7f78b3a1_n.jpg alt="sugar and cinnamon" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="plus raisins" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4689/24336124877_c3676ebf3f_n.jpg alt="plus raisins" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="some breadcrumbs to help absorb" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4637/24336125717_9b963c574b_n.jpg alt="some breadcrumbs to help absorb" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="all filled -- but you should use a little more" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4600/24336124717_7efb74e45d_n.jpg alt="all filled -- but you should use a little more" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I realize that Dutch apple pie may not be everyone’s or even most people’s Christmas tradition but will you look at this glorious thing? I think it deserves a chance. It’s fragrant and buttery and rustic but fancy and the only proper way to eat it, or so many things worth eating, is mit schlag (with whipped cream), really an inordinate amount too, so save those dainty dollops for a different party. I also want to warn you about one more thing: I don’t think you have to look too deep in this site’s archives to find evidence of my devotion to American-style pie but do know that I had a single bite of this warm pie with a pillow of barely sweetened cream and wondered how or why I’d ever want to eat American apple pie again.</p><p><a title="cutting the top crust into strips" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4683/24336124027_b2bac42984_n.jpg alt="cutting the top crust into strips" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="weaving the lid" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4736/24336123637_5aaa4b977f_n.jpg alt="weaving the lid" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="finished lattice" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4736/24336123267_a64c66cffe_n.jpg alt="finished lattice" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="brushing with egg" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4738/38320840665_22f2d68f6c_n.jpg alt="brushing with egg" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="dutch apple pie / hollandse appeltaart cooling" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4686/38320840255_af949d3b70_n.jpg alt="dutch apple pie / hollandse appeltaart cooling" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="dutch apple pie / hollandse appeltaart" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4731/38320839575_5080e12449_n.jpg alt="dutch apple pie / hollandse appeltaart" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4600/38320838745_2b696590d2_n.jpg alt="dutch apple pie / hollandse appeltaart" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a title="dutch apple pie / hollandaise appeltaart" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4594/38320837635_1a69744ee2_n.jpg alt="dutch apple pie / hollandaise appeltaart" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h5></h5><p><span style=font-size:medium>* One of the most frequently asked questions in the Q&A portion of most book tour stops has been “so, what’s next?” “A nap,” I usually joke, or “Well, I’ve been super busy lately so I’m looking forward to something I called Sloth January and it involves a lot of yoga pants but very little yoga.” But I know that this is when you’re supposed to announce your product line or plans for food world domination (“perhaps, if it could be scheduled between 4 and 5 on Thursdays” is an answer I gave in an interview a few weeks ago, and probably all the reason you need to never interview me) and the honest truth is so much less headline-grabbing: I’d like to get back to blogging [cough: self-publishing] right here, for as long as right here will have me. I like it a whole lot, it makes me happy, and I’m miles from running out of ideas. I know that the obituaries have been written about blogging for half a decade now and I’ve read them all, but I’m still here and you are too, and it would be a shame if I kept any of them from getting Dutch apple pie onto our tables this weekend.</span></p><p>** True story: At my book signing in NJ last weekend, I was asked to copy several words in Latvian into a book inscription and although I had a few concerns — not speaking a word of Latvian, for all I know I was signing away my <a href=#>second born</a> and not wishing an aunt a happy 70th — I also have had zero chances to date to write anything in Latvian in my life so how could I say no?</p><h5>Previously</h5><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Homemade Irish Cream</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Eggnog Waffles + A Few Favorite Kitchen Things</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Jelly Dougnuts</a> and <a href=#>Endives with Oranges and Almonds</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Eggnog Florentines</a> and <a href=#>Linzer Torte</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Cashew Butter Balls</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Peppermint Hot Fudge Sauce</a> and <a href=#>Parsnip Latkes with Horseradish and Dill</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Iced Oatmeal Cookies</a> and <a href=#>Broiled Mussels</a><br><b>Eight years ago:</b> <a href=#>Build Your Own Smitten Kitchen</a>, <a href=#>Creamed Mushrooms on Butter-Chive Toast</a>, <a href=#>Ridiculously Easy Butterscotch Sauce</a> and <a href=#>Tip: Why Did My Cookies Spread?</a><br><b>Nine years ago:</b> <a href=#>Spelt Everything Crackers</a> and <a href=#>Feta Salsa</a> (a terrible name for a very delicious thing) and <a href=#>Carrot Cake with Maple Cream Cheese Frosting</a><br><b>Ten years ago:</b> <a href=#>Chicken and Dumplings</a> and <a href=#>Espresso Chocolate Shortbread Cookies</a> and <a href=#>Peanut Butter Cookies</a><br><b>Eleven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Pecan Squares</a> and <a href=#>Boozy Baked French Toast</a></p><p><i>And for the other side of the world:</i><br><b>Six Months Ago:</b> <a href=#>Easy Drop Berry Shortcakes</a> and <a href=#>Zucchini Grilled Cheese</a><br><b>1.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Strawberry Milk</a> and <a href=#>Corn and Black Bean Weeknight Nachos</a><br><b>2.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Strawberry Cornmeal Griddle Cakes</a>, <a href=#>Strawberry Cheesecake Ice Cream Pie</a> and <a href=#>Herbed Summer Squash Pasta Bake</a><br><b>3.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Valerie’s French Chocolate Cake</a> and <a href=#>Limonada de Coco/Frozen Coconut Limeade</a><br><b>4.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Espresso Granita with Whipped Cream</a></p><p style="border-bottom:1px dashed #6b7794"></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Dutch Apple Pie / Hollandse Appeltaart</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>8 to 12</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>2 hours</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong>Cobbled together from several sources</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul>Although most recipes I found had fairly common proportions, there were things that were inconsistent: some used self-rising flour, or added baking powder, but most did not. Some used only cinnamon (and a full tablespoon of it) to spice the filling, a few, but not many, others used several “apple pie spices” including ground ginger, nutmeg and more. All used raisins. Some plumped them first in brandy or rum but I never did, figuring they’d get plumped with spiced juices from the apples, a delicious thought. Many used 1 tablespoon vanilla-scented “custard powder” (an ingredient less common in the US) as a thickener (a mix of cornstarch and vanilla sugar would have a similar effect) but most others sprinkled the bottom crust with only plain breadcrumbs and one, semolina, to absorbed juices, something that fascinated me as controlling the juices in pies is a bit of an American pie-making obsessed. The choices I made, and loved, are reflected below but feel free to use all of the information here to tweak your version to your tastes.<p>One last note: I was convinced I had cut up too many apples (the amount below) and ended up with an underfilled pie. Don’t let this happen to you; use them all, even if it towers over the rim slightly before baking. It will all even out before it is done.</p><ul><h5>Crust</h5><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 1/3 cups (300 grams) all-purpose flour</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>14 tablespoons (200 grams) butter, diced, no need to soften</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 large egg</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 tablespoons (30 ml) cold water</li><h5>Filling and finish</h5><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>3 1/3 pounds (1500 grams or about 5 large apples) peeled, cored and sliced</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 tablespoon (15 ml) lemon juice</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>About 1/2 cup (70 grams) raisins</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>4 tablespoons plain breadcrumbs (I used panko)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 large egg, beaten, to finish</li></ul><i>Make your dough:</i> In the bottom of a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Add the diced butter and using a pastry blender or your fingertips, work the butter into the flour until the mixture looks like coarse cornmeal, with the largest pieces the size of small peas. Add the egg, vanilla, and water, and if using a pastry blender, use that to work them into the butter-flour mixture, or if not, use a fork to work it in. Reach hands into bowl and lightly knead the mixture together into a single mass. Transfer to a piece of parchment or waxed paper or plastic wrap, and wrap it tightly. Chill in fridge until firm, at least 60 minutes.<p><i>At some point during this hour, make the filling:</i> Combine apples, lemon, cinnamon, sugar and raisins in a large bowl and toss to combine.</p><p><i>Assemble crust:</i> Coat a 9- to 9 1/2-inch (24 cm) diameter springform pan lightly with butter or nonstick cooking spray. Remove chilled dough from fridge and cut it roughly into thirds. On a well-floured counter, roll the first third to a circle the diameter your pan and fit it into the bottom. Roll out the second third of the dough and cut it into strips the height of your springform pan (usually 3 inches). Patch them up the inner sides of the springform. Use your fingertips to press and seal the sides and base together. If any holes form or there are spots you’re worried aren’t sealed well, patch in another pinch of dough.</p><p><i>Heat your oven:</i> To 350°F (175°C).</p><p><i>Assemble pie:</i> Sprinkle the bottom of the pie crust with breadcrumbs. Pour the apple-raisin mixture on top. Roll the last third of the dough into a large round and cut into thin strips. (Mine were about 1/2-inch wide.) Space them in a lattice pattern over the filling, either by arranging half in one direction and the second half in the other direction on top, or by getting cute and weaving them together. (<a href=#>Here is an ancient set of directions from me.</a>) Trim the overhang so that the latticed top meets the walls of the crust, and press/pinch them together to seal it. Brush beaten egg over top crust.</p><p><i>Bake:</i> For 60 to 70 minutes, until you can see filling bubbling slightly up between the latticed strips (use this to determine doneness, and the baking time as just an estimate), and crust is a deep golden brown. Let cool in springform on rack for 45 minutes or so before running a knife around the outside of the crust to ensure it isn’t sticking to the pan in any place, and opening the ring to serve it with an abundance of softly whipped, barely sweetened cream.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-34530 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-34530 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

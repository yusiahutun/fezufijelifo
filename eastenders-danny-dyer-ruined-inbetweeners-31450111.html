He had been presenting an intense game show on Netflix, together with comedienne and Ted Lasso star Ellie Taylor. Titled Cheat, the show was one of the cheeky chap's first TV gigs after he chose to leave Walford last <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Christmas</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31441742.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Danny-Dyer.jpg><p>But <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun</a> has now reported that bosses at the streaming platform have called time on the project, ending the show after just on season. Speaking to the publication, a source close to the show claimed that the show's premise had run its course. "Danny was great as host, as was Ellie, but Netflix thought one series was just about right," the insider said. "It didn’t pick up a big following and will hardly go down in game show folklore. He enjoyed making the series, especially banking the pay cheque.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>Join the Daily Star Soaps WhatsApp for all the latest spoilers and exclusives</b></a></p><p>Cheat's premise is to see contestants lie their way through a quiz in order to win a cool £50,000. Those competing on the show were pushed to cheat by giving the impression they knew the answers, but had to ensure they were not caught out.</p><p>Danny, ever the wordsmith, would regularly berate the contestants, branding them "rascals" and "lying scumbags", amongst other things. But as one project ends, Danny is patiently waiting to see if another show he is on will be brought back.</p><p>Together with daughter <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Dani</a>, Dyer hosts a travel series with the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Love Island</a> winner on E4. No information has been revealed on whether the show will be making a return to screens.</p><p>Danny is keen to keep the money flowing in after he chose to leave Albert Square in dramatic scenes last year. Since his time on the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>BBC</a> soap ended, he has been spotted in a number of shows including Channel 5 drama Heat, as well as hit new Disney+ series Rivals.</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up for one of our newsletters <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>here</a></i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlonJqrpJq7pbHRrGSdmZ6jxm6w2J6pZqqlnrumsIyipZudpKyyprrEq6pma2FpgnF9kGo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

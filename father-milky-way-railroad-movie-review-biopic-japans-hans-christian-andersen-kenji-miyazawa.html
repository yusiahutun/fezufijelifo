His film follows the brief yet fruitful life of novelist and poet Kenji Miyazawa, who is today regarded as one of the finest writers of children’s literature to have emerged from the late Taisho and early Showa periods in Japan – broadly, the 1920s and early ’30s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Narushima’s approach is to chronicle Miyazawa’s childhood and short life from the point of view of his parents, a wealthy pawnbroker couple from Iwate prefecture.</p>After initially hoping that his son would follow him into the family business, Kenji’s father, Masajiro (<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Koji Yakusho</span></a>), is supportive of his boy’s wish to continue with his studies. However, every time Kenji (Masaki Suda) returns home, he appears to be increasingly troubled.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whether pursuing different Buddhist disciplines or becoming involved in campaigning for farmers’ rights, the young man’s unbridled, yet also untamed passion proves increasingly destabilising.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/05/ec884ec0-c340-4362-bc39-fa6e08ab5d4e_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His younger sister Toshi (Nana Mori) is equally enthusiastic about her brother’s writing, and urges him to continue creating the beautifully descriptive tales that would earn him the nickname “the Hans Christian Andersen of Japan”. But when tragedy strikes the family, Kenji becomes irrevocably untethered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As portrayed by Suda, Miyazawa remains a largely enigmatic figure, wandering in and out of his parents’ lives – and the movie – without giving viewers much with which to make an emotional connection.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Audiences who do not already have a strong familiarity with Miyazawa’s writings will remain largely in the dark as to what he wrote about and why it continues to prove so popular to this day.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">10 best movies of Memoirs of a Geisha, Babel actor Koji Yakusho</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During his lifetime, Miyazawa’s novels and poetry went largely ignored, and Narushima struggles to find a suitably dramatic pay-off for his film, save for killing off a procession of family members.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is nothing on screen to suggest that beloved novels such as Night on the Galactic Railroad – from which the film takes its title – would be adapted into enduringly popular stage plays, musicals and films in the years to follow.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All we are able to glean from Narushima’s film is that Miyazawa wielded a deftness for describing the natural world in a visually poetic manner, and that his own parents only came to appreciate his craft in the twilight of his young life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/05/8d739f74-98b2-43de-af42-0d36e0905717_4dfbd792.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the uninitiated, Father of the Milky Way Railroad leaves Miyazawa and his art frustratingly out of reach.</p>Want more articles like this?

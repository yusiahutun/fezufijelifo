The regulatory body has underscored the association of these products with severe side effects, ranging from seizures and loss of consciousness to fatal outcomes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Collaborating with local and state health departments</h2><p>Highlighting the gravity of the situation, the FDA emphasized that the use of Neptune’s Fix may lead to life-threatening interactions with other medications a consumer might be taking. The agency is actively collaborating with local and state health departments to investigate adverse event reports associated with these supplements.</p><p>Neptune Resources, the manufacturer of these controversial supplements, has taken a proactive step by voluntarily recalling all remaining lots of Neptune’s Fix Elixir, Neptune’s Fix Extra Strength Elixir, and Neptune’s Fix Tablets. This comes in the wake of the FDA’s earlier communication to gas stations and convenience stores, urging them to cease the sale of these products.</p><p>The FDA had previously issued a warning to consumers in November, advising against the purchase of Warning on Neptune’s Fix and similar products containing tianeptine. The agency labeled tianeptine as a “potentially dangerous substance” being “illegally sold with claims to improve brain function and treat anxiety, depression, pain, opioid use disorder, and other conditions.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Uncontrolled’ drug: FDA Warning on Neptune’s Fix supplements | NewsNation Prime</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p class="responsive-video-wrap clr"></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The regulatory body remains committed to ensuring public safety&nbsp;</h2><p>Importantly, it is crucial to note that tianeptine holds no approval for medical use in the United States, as confirmed by both the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC has pointed out a disturbing trend, highlighting a surge in serious side effects associated with tianeptine. In 2020 alone, poison control centers reported 151 cases of tianeptine exposure, indicating a concerning uptick in incidents linked to this substance.</p><p>The FDA’s advisory serves as a stern reminder to consumers to exercise extreme caution when it comes to unapproved supplements and substances. The agency continues to monitor the situation closely and urges individuals who may have experienced adverse effects from Warning on Neptune’s Fix or similar products to report their cases promptly. As investigations unfold, the regulatory body remains committed to ensuring public safety and preventing further harm from the use of these potentially hazardous supplements.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Also Read: <a href=#>F.D.A.

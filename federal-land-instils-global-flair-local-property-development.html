From the developers of this iconic building comes another architectural marvel - the Grand Hyatt Hotel and Grand Hyatt Manila Residences complex rising in Bonifacio Global City (BGC), an upscale business and residential centre close to Makati.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Federal Land, a member of major conglomerate GT Capital Holdings, has been at the forefront of residential and commercial developments that have changed the landscape of the Philippine real estate sector.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We are coming out from our previous low-key approach," says Alfred Ty, Federal Land president and Bonifacio Landmark Corp (BLC) chairman of the board. "We need to look at our developments not just in a local fashion but in a more regional sense, especially with the integration of the Asean community."&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Formerly known as Federal Homes, Federal Land has evolved from a small company into one of the country's prime developers. With an expertly trained eye in choosing strategic locations, Federal Land embarks on simultaneous developments to target different market segments. In almost all of the Philippines' trade hubs, such as BGC, Makati, Manila's Chinatown, Quezon city, the Manila Bay area and Cebu, Federal Land is sure to be present.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"With continuous development, we learn what our audience is looking for - good quality, good space planning, useful amenities combined with reasonable costing. Putting all these elements together has always been Federal Land's focus," Ty says.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Federal Land inspires confidence in real estate clients and foreign investors. The company has forged a partnership with Japan-based property developer and financial services firm ORIX Corp in developing elegantly designed commercial and residential properties that have attracted local and international tenants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cooperation between Federal Land and ORIX paved the way for developments such as The Grand Midori Makati. The 38-storey twin-tower luxury condominium located at the quiet side of Makati's business hub is a showcase of Filipino and Japanese aesthetics - grandeur, artistry and simplicity combined. Japanese Zen gardens on every floor and a koi pond at the lobby are seamlessly integrated into The Grand Midori Makati's premises by one of the Philippines' most renowned architectural firms, W.V. Coscolluela & Associates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Embarking on another project, Federal Land and ORIX have come together under joint-venture firm BLC to introduce two new luxurious destinations in BGC - the Grand Hyatt Hotel and Grand Hyatt Manila Residences. Slated for completion early next year, the Grand Hyatt complex will rise in the middle of Veritown Fort, a thriving business and leisure hub in Taguig.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Grand Hyatt complex features two upscale mixed-use towers - the 66-storey hotel and the residential building housing 220 luxury units. Upholding the trademark opulence of the Grand Hyatt brand, BLC ensures that signature elements such as dramatic architecture, spa and fitness centres, swimming pool, food and beverage facilities, and comprehensive business and meeting facilities are available in the hotel.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Connected to the hotel by a common podium, the Grand Hyatt Manila Residences suits the different lifestyles of its residents with luxurious amenities such as a lap pool with jacuzzi, a landscaped outdoor area, a game room, a yoga and Pilates room and a children's playroom.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Federal Land prides itself in bringing world-class hospitality brands to the Philippines. Outside Metro Manila, Federal Land introduced premier hotel group Marco Polo to Cebu.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Managed by Hong Kong-based group Marco Polo Hotels, the five-star Marco Polo Plaza, Cebu has been dubbed Hotel of the Year in Asia by the Marco Polo Hotels organisation because of its high-quality accommodations, superb dining choices and overall guest services.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Contributing to the vibrant environment of the central Philippine city, Federal Land has also embarked on the development of Marco Polo Residences.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dubbed the most desirable address in Cebu, Marco Polo Residences boasts five-star amenities and a stunning panorama of the city.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Federal Land aims to continue on its path of raising standards in the local real estate sector to match those abroad. The company is open to partnerships with international property developers to gain a more cosmopolitan aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We welcome a different mindset and a different way of looking at things to add value to the market," says Pascual Garcia, Federal Land chairman and BLC director. "Why go abroad when Federal Land can offer that type of experience?"&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdhbIR5gpFuZp%2BdlJq%2ForiMpZinnF2eu7TAyKWqZp%2BcpK%2BiuIyfo5qhomK5sK%2FApWSpqp%2BlsrPA2Gabnq6VobyxucSnqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

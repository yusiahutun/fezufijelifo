But because PLV is queer, they are getting hate,” she said, using the initials for Pagente’s drag name, Pura Luka Vega. “We see religion and queerness as something that’s separate in the Philippines. It’s either you’re queer or you’re religious.”</p>Since taking office in 2013, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Francis has also made clear that he believes homosexuality is a sin, while Church doctrine states same-sex acts are “intrinsically disordered”.</p><h3

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Father Jerome Secillano of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines said the Church criticised Pagente’s performance because it was “disrespectful” of the faith.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I have no problem with him being gay, I have no problem with whatever his queerness is,” Secillano said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">LGBTQ people are welcome in the Church, Secillano said, but “you must be willing to change for God because God will not change for you”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch said the Catholic Church in the Philippines was “pretty liberal” compared to other countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But he said if LGBTQ people felt they could not freely express themselves without fear of being harmed or threatened, “then I think we have a problem”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Conde said laws protecting religious feelings should be reviewed to ensure they were not “harming freedom of expression”.</p><img

css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In recent decades, the LGBTQ community has become increasingly visible in public and on television in the Philippines.</p>The Annual Gay Pride marches draw thousands of people, and LGBTQ groups are found across the country and on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">social media</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Serrano said the LGBTQ community still “faced discrimination on a daily basis”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A survey conducted by local pollster Social Weather Stations in early 2023 showed mixed views.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It found 79 per cent of respondents agreed that “gays or lesbians are just as trustworthy as any other Filipino”, while 73 per cent said they have contributed a lot to society.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But 40 per cent said they would like their gay or lesbian family members to become straight, and 26 per cent thought being gay or lesbian was “contagious”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9

LGBTQ rights, described Pagente’s performance as “regrettable”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, she urged people not to use the incident “to deny rights and protections to a community that has long been marginalised and excluded”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hontiveros is sponsoring a bill that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, which progressive members of congress have been trying to get approved for more than 20 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has faced stiff opposition from conservative lawmakers and religious leaders, who claim it would be a stepping stone to same-sex marriage and would infringe on the rights of the Catholic Church and schools.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As he fights to stay out of jail, Pagente continues to perform in drag shows and remains defiant about dressing up as Jesus.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can’t tell me what I can and cannot do in terms of expressing my faith or how I express my queerness,” he said. “No one has an exclusive ownership of the concept of Jesus.”</p><p

Ng, who was looking for profits of $81 million, said that after meeting with management in April he had expected the Thousand Island operation to at least break even.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">''I talked to them about it [Thousand Island] but they told me it wasn't doing well,'' he said. ''I didn't expect a loss. I think some analysts were probably misled.'' Nomura Research analyst Gordon Crosbie-Walsh said he was disappointed with Fairwood's results after looking for profits of $76 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said that during a meeting with management five weeks ago there was no mention that Thousand Island would lose money.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, it appears that not every investment house was in the dark about Thousand Island. W.I. Carr, Jardine Fleming and Credit Lyonnais lowered their earning forecasts after being told it would lose money.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to The Estimate Directory, Jardine Fleming forecast on April 30 that Fairwood would make $82 million. This was lowered last month to $73 million after a visit with the company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fairwood director of finance and administration Kenneth Ying Tze-man said a number of analysts who closely followed the stock and who had met with management were told about Thousand Island's troubles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, he said it was not something he talked about every time an analyst called.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Ying said some analysts might not have realised the significance of rental increases on Fairwood's bottom line.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said 17 leases came up for rental adjustment, which took place half-way through a six-year lease, compared with just five in 1991-92. Many rents jumped 25 to 30 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rental costs were also increased by the growth of the Mario Italian Restaurant chain, located in prime areas commanding higher rents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An encouraging development was the growth of Fairwood's operations in China, which posted a profits of $3 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Ying said the five stores in southern China opened in October and had not enjoyed the strong sales that usually took place during the summer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fairwood plans to open 10 restaurants in the next three to four months with the goal of having more than 20 outlets in Shenzhen, Dongguan, Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fairwood's stock, which had traded as high as $5.10 in late March, dropped 15 cents yesterday to $3.15. It now has a price-earnings multiple of 19.6 and a prospective 1994 PE of 13.6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdjbn92go6fpqicXaW5osbAZqOoq6OawG6vx6iinmWWlrazw86omw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

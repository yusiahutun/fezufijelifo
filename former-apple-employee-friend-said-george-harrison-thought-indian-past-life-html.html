The former Beatle fell in love with the country’s culture in the mid-1960s. He loved that the old traditions remained and that spirituality ruled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/George-Harrison-Indian-1.jpg><h2 id=h-a-former-apple-employee-said-george-harrison-believed-he-was-indian-in-a-past-life>A former Apple employee said George Harrison believed he was Indian in a past life</h2><p id=par-2_53>In George Harrison: Behind the Locked Door, Graeme Thomson wrote that “physically, spiritually and emotionally,” George found very little of himself in his home city of Liverpool. After finding spirituality in the mid-1960s, George had little ties to much else. His real <a href=#>home wasn’t Liverpool</a>, but anywhere he could connect with God.</p><p id=par-3_24>Thomson wrote that George’s “eternal spirit, born and reborn over and over again, simply re-entered ‘a body’ at that particular place and that time.”</p><p id=par-4_42>“It was quite clear to me that he believed that in <a href=#>a prior life</a> he was Indian,” said Chris O’Dell, a former Apple employee who later became a close friend and&nbsp;lived at Friar Park with the Harrisons in the early 1970s.</p><p id=par-5_23>George speaks of being far from home in his song “World of Stone,” singing of being “such a long, long way from home.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>George became Indian in every sense</h2><p id=par-6_25>Once George started his spiritual journey, he <a href=#>traveled to India</a> as soon as possible to experience the culture firsthand. It was a life-changing experience.</p><p id=par-7_19>George kept going to India. In 1976, he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">India Today</a>&nbsp;that he loved the country because the “ancient traditions remain.”</p><p id=par-8_32>“It’s not mechanical and material like the West. The Gurus and masters are here and it’s possible to raise your God-consciousness,” George said. However, George said the tragedy was Indian youth.</p><p id=par-9_60>“When you have such a fascinating culture yourself, why turn to the West? If the “love generation” was a Western fad, your Anglicization is a far more dangerous permanent sickness. Don’t re-discover Indian culture through the Beatles when it’s all around you. Somebody here was telling me that kids eat beef steak. If that’s westernization, I think I’ll stay here.”</p><p id=par-10_41>In 1967, George told The International Times (per&nbsp;George Harrison on George Harrison: Interviews and Encounters) that he <a href=#>didn’t have to communicate with people</a> in India. Everyone just understood each other on a cosmic level. There was also a humbleness there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>The Beatle preferred Indian music to any other form of music</h2><p id=par-11_29>George didn’t just love India as a country; he listened to Indian music more than any other form, even though he knew <a href=#>it didn’t fit in in the West</a>.</p><p id=par-12_69>According to Joshua M. Greene’s Here Comes The Sun: The Spiritual And Musical Journey Of George Harrison, music journalist, Ray Coleman asked&nbsp;George about his love of Indian music. “I don’t fancy myself as the next Ravi&nbsp;Shankar,” George said, “but I still prefer Indian music to any other form of music.&nbsp;It has taken over 100 percent in my musical life. . . . Just learning the sitar has inspired me.”</p><p id=par-13_46>“You know how God is a, sort of, untouchable&nbsp;thing?” George asked. “Well, that’s how it is with Indian music. It’s a very spiritual&nbsp;thing, so subtle and related to philosophy and life. It’s not easy to understand the&nbsp;music at first, but it’s beautiful when you get it.”</p><p id=par-14_25>Without Indian music, George wouldn’t have had his distinct slide guitar sound. Nor would he have been able to&nbsp;<a href=#>connect to God</a>&nbsp;through notes as beautifully.</p><p id=par-15_62>George said listening to Indian music for the first time felt like it was “<a href=#>calling him back to a place he already knew</a>.” Maybe that’s because George had been Indian in his past life. Fortunately, George made it to India one last time before he went to the spiritual realm. He <a href=#>bathed in the Ganges River</a> like so many before him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzsL7MnqlmmaCluaZ5xKanpaepmrJustGinKecXaiuqrCMoJyoqpeaeqmt0augrKeeYsGpu9Sgn61lmaOxqq3NZqeaq6RiuaqyxGefraWcZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

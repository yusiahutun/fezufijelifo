They need to fit my thighs, be stretchy enough to sit in all day (but not so stretchy that they lose shape after two wears) and most importantly, they need to make my booty look good.</p><p>As a woman teetering between straight- and plus-size, the quest to find great denim takes a new life. It’s no easy feat finding something that doesn’t look utterly shapeless and hugs my curves, rather than skimming over them. All I want are jeans I feel good in and that’s surprisingly a really huge task when your size is in the teens. Hey, I love my body — all I want is for my pants to do the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2210125-4GL.76627_2.jpg><p>This is why I was so excited to try <a href=# rel=noopener>Frank and Oak</a>. The Canada-based brand uses premium, sustainable materials and makes styles for both men and women. After launching jeans last summer (spoiler alert: It sold out) the label chose to re-issue<a href=# rel=noopener> denim</a> in new fits and washes. Each of the five styles are named after legendary rockstars. The <a href=# rel=noopener>flared Joni</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>wide-leg Nina</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>relaxed Billie</a> fits are the new kids on the block, while the <a href=# rel=noopener>high-rise Debbie</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>tapered Stevie</a> styles are rollovers from last year. Each pair of jeans produced by Frank and Oak requires 79 percent less energy, 95 percent less water and 50 percent fewer chemicals to create than conventional cotton ones.</p><p>I’m not much of a skinny denim kind of girl, so I was immediately attracted to the relaxed fit of <a href=# rel=noopener>the Billie</a>. They’re a flattering mid-rise and have a tapered leg, plus they’re available in both a distressed light wash and a dark rinse. I stayed true to my usual size when placing my order and when they arrived, they immediately reminded me of a pair an ex-boyfriend once passed on to me. The denim felt thick and sturdy and had practically zero stretch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_2140.jpg><p>The real shock came after I tried them on. They didn’t just fit well, but&nbsp;really&nbsp;well. Despite not being stretchy at all, they felt like I’d already worn them for years. They just molded onto my body in a way that some of the more expensive pairs I own take multiple wears to do. Most importantly, they made my butt look good — so good that even my neighbor asked me where she can get her own.</p><p>Don’t just take my word for it. I coerced two of my coworkers to try on the Frank and Oak styles with me and they were just as into them as I was.</p><p>Commerce writer Marquaysa Battle also tried on the <a href=# rel=noopener>Billie</a>&nbsp;and she couldn’t get enough of the boyfriend fit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image_from_ios.jpg><p>“These are definitely made of quality denim,” she raved. “They feel sturdy but not uncomfortable against my skin. I’m pretty sure these pants are going to last a long time.”</p><p>Check out the detailing on the Billie:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image_from_ios-1.jpg><p>Commerce writer Tatayana Yomary tried on the <a href=# rel=noopener>high-rise Stevie</a>&nbsp;and she loved how it hugged her curves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/image_from_ios-2.jpg><p>“I love the tapered fit and high rise construction,” she said. “It showcases my curves perfectly for a flattering finish.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Billie</a> stretched a tad bit on me after a few hours of wearing them, but they still looked and felt great. Most importantly, they were comfortable enough for wearing all morning — even after running around after my dog, commuting and spending all morning sitting at my desk. Jeans are always the first thing I want to take off when I get home after a long day and something tells me that I’ll probably forget I’m even wearing them later.</p><p><strong>Want a pair of your own?

The idea of spending all day in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>workout clothes</a> makes my skin crawl; it just seems uncomfortable and stifling. In fact, my distaste for activewear is so strong that I&nbsp; take off my workout outfit within 30 seconds of finishing my exercise. So, imagine my surprise when I found an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">FP Movement workout set</a> from Free People that’s not only so comfortable that I don’t mind wearing it for longer periods of time, but that I bought a second one to wear as pajamas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hot Shot Reversible Set </a>comes in 11 colors, including fun options like coral and lime and classics like black and navy, and sizes XS to XL. I’m a size 14/16 and the XL fits me comfortably. And thanks to the roomy, oversized style, I think it could even fit people who are a bigger size than I am.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 95 percent cotton material is buttery soft from the get-go. It’s got the comfort of that oversized pajama shirt you now covet because after years of washes, it’s the softest thing you own. One side of the shirt features a deep V neckline and the other has a crew neck; the reversible aspect of the garment is that it can be worn either way. I tend to fluctuate between the two depending on what type of workout I’m doing. The oversized shirt also features pockets on both sides.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the shorts, the waist has a very stretchy, non-constricting elastic. There’s no struggle, no huffing and puffing — or that thing where you have to contort your body while pulling them on.&nbsp; stay put on your body, and there’s no pinching in the waistband or leg openings.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As I said, I initially began wearing this set to do my home workouts (shout out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>MonikaFit</a>), but I wasn’t ripping it off my body like it was poison ivy the minute I was done. In fact after my workouts, I continued to wear the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hot Shot set</a> for hours —&nbsp;if not the rest of the day. The moment I truly realized how comfortable it was is when I fell asleep in it on my couch. When I woke up, I was actually upset that I had tarnished it with sweat and would therefore be unable to wear it in bed. Thus, I bought my second set and it’s become my favorite pajamas/house clothes I own.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Head to Free People to shop the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">FP Movement Hot Shot Reversible Set</a> and experience the comfort yourself.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xaucnmWgmryxuMRmpKiulaKyr8CMoaatZaOdvLV50Z6tnqqjnq%2BtsYysnK1loprDqrHWZm9scGNrfXQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

None of them were left in the Northern fortress except for the young Lord Ned Umber, dead and nailed to the wall amidst a slew of severed limbs in a spiral pattern.</p><img alt="Darkness, Fire, Night, Tradition, Heat, Event, Geological phenomenon, Temple, Flame, " title="Darkness, Fire, Night, Tradition, Heat, Event, Geological phenomenon, Temple, Flame, " width=2880 height=1600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2019-04-15-at-10-08-19-am-1555337375.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tormund, Beric Dondarrion, Dolorous Edd, and their crew find the haunting symbol when they arrive to Last Hearth.

But what is the Night King saying?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At face value, it means the White Walkers are marching south quickly.

The Night King has a penchant for leaving behind his victims in spooky patterns. In the very first scene of Season 1, Episode 1, a man of the Night's Watch finds corpses in the woods lying in an eerie formation. It wasn't a spiral, but creepy nonetheless.<br></p><img alt="Freezing, Winter, Ice, " title="Freezing, Winter, Ice, " width=2000 height=1108 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2019-04-15-at-8-49-47-am-copy-1555332649.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span><p>Season 1, Episode 1</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In Season 3, Episode 3, Jon Snow and a group of Wildlings (including Mance Rayder, Tormund, and Ygritte) find dead horses beyond the wall in the shape of the spiral.</p><img alt="Winter, Adaptation, Snow, Freezing, Ice cap, Arctic, Glacial landform, " title="Winter, Adaptation, Snow, Freezing, Ice cap, Arctic, Glacial landform, " width=2880 height=1604 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2019-04-15-at-8-52-49-am-1555332868.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The Children of the Forest have used it too.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It turns out the White Walkers aren't the only ones associated with the spiral motif. While traveling back in time in Season 6, Episode 5, Bran discovers the same pattern in the stones surrounding the weirwood tree where the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a11653035/game-of-thrones-children-of-the-forest/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Children of the Forest" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Children of the Forest</a> first created the Night King.

These are patterns that have mystical significance for the children of the forest, we're not sure exactly what they signify, but spiral patterns are important in a lot of different cultures in our world, and it makes sense that they would be in this world as well."<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To refresh your memory, the Children of the Forest, the original inhabitants of Westeros, first created the White Walkers as a weapon to protect themselves against the First Men when they were invaded thousands of years before the events on Game of Thrones. However, the White Walkers later got out of control and the First Men had to team up with the Children of the Forest to fight the icy beings in a battle called the War for the Dawn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So why did the White Walkers adopt the spiral symbol? Are they reminding mankind of their defeat in the War for the Dawn? Are they about to take out their revenge on the Children of the Forest on humans? As <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://time.com/5570506/game-of-thrones-spiral/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Time class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Time</a> points out, in real-life, some ancient cultures have used the spiral to signify rebirth or progression. If the GoT showrunners were inspired by real history to create these symbols, is repeating past events part of the White Walkers' plan?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some fans also thought the spiral looks like the Targaryen sigil of the three-headed dragon. Could the mysterious symbol be a threat to the Targaryens, the traditional rulers of Westeros?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perhaps we'll find out in GoT's final episodes.

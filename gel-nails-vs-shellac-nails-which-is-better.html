However, deciding on polish color, nail art, and nail shape aren't the only choices to make when getting gel nails. You might even be asked whether you want a Shellac or gel manicure or told that the salon only offers one versus the other.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, what's the difference between gel nails and Shellac nails, and which option is better? We turned to experts Jennifer Bell and Tamara Di Lullo to help clear up the confusion and break down the benefits — and downsides — of each manicure.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li>Jennifer Bell is a nail expert and the senior marketing manager at&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Bellacures</a>.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Tamara Di Lullo</a>&nbsp;is a nail artist and founder of Candy Nail Bar in Montréal.

"The UV light immediately adheres the gel to your nail bed by hardening with a thirty-second to one-minute dry time," said Bell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are two types of gels that are popular at nail salons today: soft gel and hard gel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Soft gels have a thinner makeup and can be soaked off with acetone," explained Bell. "Hard gels are just that — much harder and thicker. While they last much longer than a soft gel application, they do require professional removal."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-a-shellac-manicure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is a Shellac Manicure?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shellac is a patented brand name of gel polish created by&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CND</a>&nbsp;in 2010. "It combines the best features of a polish with the best features of a gel: a fully removable hybrid UV-cured nail color," said Di Lullo.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The benefits of a Shellac manicure include over 14 days of glossy wear, no drying time at the salon, and easy removal that doesn't damage nails. To ride out the life of your Shellac manicure as long as possible, Di Lullo recommended avoiding harsh solvents (like cleaning products) and treating the cuticles with a nourishing oil like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>CND's Solaroil</a>&nbsp;($10).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It contains jojoba oil and vitamin E and keeps Shellac flexible and chip-free — not to mention, gorgeously hydrated cuticles," Di Lullo added.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-side-effects-of-a-gel-manicure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Side Effects of a Gel Manicure</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A gel manicure will last much longer than one with traditional nail polish, but the service does have a few downsides. Namely, incorrect removal can result in nail damage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The main way in which soft gels can cause damage to your nails in the removal process," Bell said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Soft gel is removed with acetone, and it's important not to pull or peel it off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Allowing the polish to be soaked off and gently filed off manually is the best way to remove the polish safely without causing any damage to your nail," Bell shared. "If the gel starts to lift, peeling the polish off is one of the worst options, as you can take a layer of your nail away with it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For hard gel, you must go to a professional for removal.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While hard gel products, such as BioGel, cover the nail bed for a longer period of time and allow the nail to grow out longer, they must be removed by a professional nail technician using an e-file," Bell said. "Since this product cannot be soaked off, attempting to remove it in any way on your own could result in some serious damage."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-side-effects-of-a-shellac-manicure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Side Effects of a Shellac Manicure</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Shellac polish itself doesn't damage nails, incorrect removal does. "The main cause of nail damage I see is if the product is ripped or filed off the nail by an uncertified nail professional or the client themselves," Di Lullo said. "I usually say Shellac doesn't damage nails; humans do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gel polish is typically best removed with acetone. We recommend&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CDN Offly Fast™ Moisturizing Remover</a>&nbsp;for its Shellac formula (bonus: it also hydrates nails). Acetone is notoriously drying, which is why nail professionals advise using a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>cuticle oil</a>&nbsp;post-removal.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-choose-between-a-gel-and-shellac-manicure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Choose Between a Gel and Shellac Manicure</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on what brands your nail salon carries, the choice may be made for you. If that's the case, you'll end up with a shiny, long-lasting manicure either way. However, if you have the option to pick between gel polish and Shellac polish, consider the current state of your nails and whether you'll be removing the manicure yourself at home or will have it done at the salon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you go with the former option, Shellac may be the better option because it's typically easier to remove, which, in turn, is less likely to cause damage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are a number of gel polish brands on the market, unlike CND Shellac, which easily and safely can be removed with no nail damage. Some gel polish brands can be much harder to remove and require scraping or filing of the natural nail plate," Di Lullo said. "That's why the whole category of gel polish sadly gets a bad rap."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-fde611d1-fe93-4727-abb0-8373ddd2620c></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are Shellac nails more expensive than gel nails?</span></p><p>A Shellac manicure and a gel manicure are usually around the same price ($25-$45).

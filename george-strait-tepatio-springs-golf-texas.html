They purchased the 250-acre Tapatio Springs Golf Resort and Conference Center in Boerne, Texas, about 25 miles northwest of San Antonio.</p><p><span id=more-21371></span>"I have lived near Boerne, and over the years Tom and I watched what was happening at Tapatio Springs and we always believed it could be a real jewel," Strait <a href=#>says</a>. "When the opportunity came up, we decided to go for it and make this dream come true."</p><p>The property has been in foreclosure since last June and the deal was finalized on April 1, with the news made public on Friday morning, April 8. Strait and his friend are said to have paid in the neighborhood of $4.5 million.</p><p>Tapatio Springs Golf Resort and Conference Center features a resort hotel complete with tennis, swimming&nbsp;and 27 holes of golf. In the words of one of Strait's No. 1 hits, he explains, "We have begun our master plan and want the end result to be extraordinary. This may not be 'ocean front property,' but it's the next best thing."</p><p>Cusick <a href=#>adds</a>, "The resort has suffered through uncertainty, rumors and a lack of maintenance. George and I are making a personal commitment to eliminate those issues and turn Tapatio Springs into the showplace it should be. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to turn Tapatio Springs into an incredible resort that will attract golfers and visitors from across the country. We are putting together an all-star team to take Tapatio Springs to a completely new level, a point of pride for members and guests, homeowners and the entire Boerne area."</p><p>Strait has&nbsp;been touring with <a href=#>Reba McEntire</a> and <a href=#>Lee Ann Womack</a>, but he is now enjoying some time off&nbsp;that will&nbsp;probably include a few golf games -- such as last week's Augusta National course in Georgia, where he was spotted playing last week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJ2fp7SmedKtqZqhpGLBprzAraCoZaOlv6q6xqxkoKecm3q1sdeaqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

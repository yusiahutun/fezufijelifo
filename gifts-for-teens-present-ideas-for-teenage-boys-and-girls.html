Teens can be hard to buy for – and with that in mind, we’ve scoured the best online retailers for the best <a class=hm-link href=#>present ideas</a> for teen girls and teen boys of all ages.</p><p id=eD7OmRcbsXS data-wc=46>Whether you’re shopping for your fashion and beauty-obsessed teen niece or your avid gamer teen son, we've got you covered. These cool gifts are the best ones you can find for Christmas 2023 and they'll earn you major brownie points on birthdays and special occasions too!</p><p id=ewOeXuEu09p data-wc=71>Our Senior Lifestyle editor <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Karen Silas</a> was on our testing panel and knows all too well the struggle of shopping for teens. She says: "After spending over a decade buying cute toys for your little one, I have to admit it’s kind of a shock to the system when your baby is suddenly a teenager with a very narrow definition of what’s cool, and a whole new repertoire of eye rolls.</p><p id=ea7uc3m3ryl data-wc=106>And to them, there’s nothing worse than a gift that says, ‘My mum gave this to me.’ I’m a mum who has nearly survived my son’s teen years, and a proud aunt of tweens. So I know that gift cards and Amazon wish lists are a godsend. But if you really want to surprise them, I’ve been most successful when I’ve paid attention to what they’re wearing – accessories have been a big hit – and what they’re chatting about when they do spare the time for us oldies. And if all that fails, channel your inner teen and check out TikTok to see what’s trending."</p><h2 dir=ltr>How we chose the best Christmas gifts for teens</h2><ul><li dir=ltr><strong>Personal experience:&nbsp;</strong>Several members of the HELLO! Online team are parents to teens or have plenty of experience in shopping for teen family members. Where possible, we included products tried and tested by us - and actually gifted to real-life teens &nbsp;- and we only recommend something if it got the thumbs up</li><li dir=ltr><strong>TikTok trends:</strong> We keep our eye on TikTok for the latest trends that teens love. If it’s hot on TikTok - or other social media, you can find it in this guide</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Reviews:&nbsp;</strong>Where we couldn’t test the products ourselves, we focused on reviews from verified shoppers - and we only included products that received a good number of consistently positive reviews.</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Variety:&nbsp;</strong>Teens come in all shapes and sizes. Some are tech-obsessed, and others are massively into makeup. We tried to include something for every type of teen.</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Price:</strong> Some shoppers might be looking for a blowout main present, and others might be looking for a gift in the ‘small treat’ variety. We tried to cater to all budgets, and looked for teen gifts on sale.</li></ul><ul class="affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf affiliateProductList_a1p8yzmf--normal" aria-label="Affiliate products list"><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/063a5cfa097e-revlon-mint-brush.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">The TikTok-approved hair tool</h3></p><p><strong>Editor's note: </strong>"A TikTok-approved hairstyler is the perfect gift for teenage girls.

There’s no mess to worry about cleaning up - the gellets are eco-friendly, non-toxic, and non-irritating and they burst on contact. There are two velocity modes and you get up to four hours of play on a single charge. This is a great gift for teens who loved Nerf guns when they were younger and are looking for something a bit extra. Just remember to use the provided safety goggles when the battle is in progress!<br></p></li><li class=affiliateProductListItem_a15uc6c7><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d538c0c3237e-inflatable-lounger.jpg><p><h3 class="affiliateProductName_afobsy4 hm-heading">Best gift under £25</h3></p><p><strong>Editor's note:</strong> "Whether they’re a festival-goer or just want to chill with friends, this lounger is amazing!

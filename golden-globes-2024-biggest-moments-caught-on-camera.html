Lip reading fans have speculated that Selena is telling Taylor that she asked for a photo with Wonka&nbsp;star Timothée Chalamet, and his partner Kylie Jenner said no. Eek!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=8f67fc3036da-gettyimages-1916058519>Rose McIver reveals pregnancy&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8f67fc3036da-gettyimages-1916058519.jpg><p>The Christmas Princess herself Rose McIver revealed her pregnancy while attending the awards.

At the Golden Globes, we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift." The camera then panned to the Blank Space&nbsp;singer, who looked unimpressed while taking a long swig of her champagne. Fair enough, Tay!</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=21abaa687918-gettyimages-1908169806>Suits cast reunited (without Meghan Markle)&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/21abaa687918-gettyimages-1908169806.jpg><p>Following the incredible recent success of Suits, lead stars Patrick J.

Years later she'd tell Taste of Country that at the time, she felt underdressed for a black tie party. It's now clear the guests at that&nbsp;party were&nbsp;happy she injected new energy into their predictable sound.</p><p>So many of the songs on this list altered the direction of country music. They were storms that trampled over predictable and introduced a sound, style or message that shook the format to its roots. Wilson's country-rock jam recalled the female outlaw style of <a href=#>Loretta Lynn</a>, but she packaged her sound with very modern-day guitars and rhythm.</p><p>Song No. 8 on Taste of Country's list of the <a href=#>Top Country Songs of the Century</a> spoke to the blue-collar, straight-shooter within us all. It was a no-frills approach at a time when frills were quite popular. Contrast her sound with the other leading ladies of the early 21st century and you'll see why she had insecurities.</p><p>In less than two months, Wilson's debut single reached No. 1 on the Billboard airplay chart — a feat nearly unimaginable today, especially for a female artist. She tied a thread from the outspoken women of two or three decades earlier to rising straight-talkers like <a href=#>Miranda Lambert</a>. "Redneck Woman" re-opened doors suddenly shut by years of slicker pop-country dominance and reverberations from the outspoken <a href=#>Dixie Chicks</a>.</p><p><strong>About this list:</strong> Taste of Country’s Top Country Songs of the Century were decided by a panel of country music experts and fans using sales and chart data, a song’s social and musical impact and lyrical integrity. Select artists were also surveyed. You’ll hear from several throughout the list.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoKqVqbCpsc1mrqKko6S7br7EnaWem5tixLC5wKdkraegYsCwusasZKieXam1pnnCnqWtraKufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

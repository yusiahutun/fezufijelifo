However, for best results, there are a few tips to know before you get your spray tan on. Not only will the right preparation ensure an even glow but it will also help to prolong your tan. To find out more, we spoke to beauty professionals to get the rundown on everything you need to know about spray tans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for your complete guide on how to prepare for a spray tan.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-in-a-spray-tan-formula></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's In a Spray Tan Formula?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If the sun's rays aren't doing any of the work, what is making your skin appear tanner? The main ingredient in spray-tan formulas is DHA, says Jules Von Hep. "This reacts with your amino acids to give the illusion of a tan. DHA is like milk. It can come in many different formats — think whole, skim, 1%, organic. From my experience, organic DHA gives the best results."</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-should-you-moisturize-before-a-spray-tan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Should You Moisturize Before a Spray Tan?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Be careful with body lotion before your spray tan. "You want to avoid heavy body lotions on the day of your spray tan, as this can interfere with the tan development," says Sophie Evans. However, you should make sure that commonly dry areas, like your elbows, knees, hands, wrists, feet, and back of the heels, are well moisturized. Evans explains that this will prevent an uneven spray tan.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-should-you-remove-body-hair-before-getting-a-spray-tan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Should You Remove Body Hair Before Getting a Spray Tan?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to remove your body hair, you should do it prior to your appointment. If you <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wax</a>, this should be done a full 24 hours prior, explains Evans. "This will ensure the hair follicles have settled and that you'll get a perfect finish," she says. You should also exfoliate a few days before your spray tan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What happens if you forgot to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shave</a>? You can shave right before, but Von Hep says to avoid using a shaving oil, as it can form a film on the skin and the tan won't penetrate properly. Shave and then splash the skin with cold water to calm the skin.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-you-wear-makeup-or-deodorant-to-your-spray-tan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can You Wear Makeup or Deodorant to Your Spray Tan?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before your spray tan, you should cleanse your skin of any makeup, fragrance, or product. This will help your spray tan apply in an even, flawless finish.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-should-you-wear-to-get-a-spray-tan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Should You Wear to Get a Spray Tan?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes product transfer occurs right after your spray tan is applied. To avoid this, wear dark clothes. Be sure they are loose to prevent straps or tight clothes from causing indentations or streaks in the tan.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-do-spray-tans-last></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Do Spray Tans Last?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Expect your tan to last five to ten days, but its lifespan is dependent on a few factors. "The longevity of the tan varies due to someone's lifestyle, beauty/skincare routine, and the pre-and post-tan care," says Alexandra DiMarchi. "The shade you chose also determines this. For example, if someone wants a light skin finish, it may fade off quicker due to a lighter application."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hormones can also come into play. Von Hep says he's noticed that some of his client's skin doesn't take to the tan as well if they're getting it done the week before they're due to start their period or on their period.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to remove your spray tan, the best option is to let it fade. If you want to expedite the process, Evans recommends using an astringent toning product or micellar water to remove the self-tan from the face. "For sensitive skin, cleanse first, lightly exfoliate with a facial scrub, then apply astringent with a cotton ball and sweep over dark areas of self-tan. Finish with your favorite moisturizer to hydrate."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-after-your-spray-tan-do-you-have-to-wait-to-shower></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long After Your Spray Tan Do You Have to Wait to Shower?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How quickly you can shower after depends on what type of spray tan you have received. However, according to Von Hep, the general rule is to wait four to six hours before getting in the shower. You should also avoid sweating, getting wet, or applying body products. Another key is staying hydrated — that means drinking water and regularly moisturizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Happy, hydrated skin won't shed and will hold onto the color for longer," says Von Hep. "If you're on a long-haul flight, try to not drink alcohol as this encourages the tan to fade due to the dehydration on the skin. Avoid hot showers and baths with oils as well as chlorinated water if you can."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-can-you-maintain-your-spray-tan-at-home></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Can You Maintain Your Spray Tan At Home?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I maintain a glow by applying self-tan to my entire body, followed by two consecutive days of rich moisturizer. Then, I apply a hit of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Isle of Paradise Happy Tan</a> to my body to lift the color back up. Two days after, I begin the scrub process, lightly exfoliating the top coat of tan off, and then apply my next coat of self-tan," says Von Hep.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Von Hep notes that your tan will fade on your face faster than the rest of your body because of the skincare products you use. He recommends adding <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Isle of Paradise's Self Tan Drops</a> to your moisturizer or serum to help revive your sun-kissed glow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you reach day five of your spray tan, DiMarchi suggests switching your body lotion for a gradual self-tanning lotion. She likes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tan-Luxe's The Gradual Tan</a>. "[This is] amazing to touch up with, especially during the warmer months because it's a lightweight formula that absorbs into your skin," says DiMarchi. "This product will be your best friend if you live in an area with lots of humidity."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-avoid-or-fix-streaks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Avoid or Fix Streaks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To avoid streaks, especially when self-tanning at home, Evans says you need to apply generously. Streaks and patches are typically caused by not using enough product and over-rubbing the skin. She recommends using enough so the lotion or oil glides easily over your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you need to fix a mistake fast, like dark marks or streaks, the quickest way is to apply baby oil to the darker area and leave for 10 minutes. This allows the exfoliation to be more effective," says Evans. "Scrub the skin with an exfoliator, then use a hot, damp washcloth to buff the skin." She also says you can try hair removal cream. Apply it with a Q-tip on the darker area and leave it on for only half of the recommended time.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Beauty School: How To Get A Bronzy Glow Like Jennifer Lopez</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-831ddfb7-9b1e-4304-a31a-2e6cb3be7950></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=45.7928802589><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How much does a spray tan cost?</span></p><p>The price of a spray tan will vary based on where you live, the salon, and whether the tanning expert is coming to your house to do it.

That's why DiMarchi recommends using a tanner that's made without colors or bronzers. "DHA in its pure form is clear and develops when it hits your skin. This is the only way to ensure no mess," she says. If you do end up with orange streaks on your sheets, a stain remover may be able to get them out, but there's no guarantee. To avoid stains on your clothing, follow the aforementioned guidelines on what to wear to your spray tan appointment.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-0.87539432176656><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you get self-tanner off of your hands?</span></p><p>Moisturize before getting a spray tan. "Remember, immediately after you have your tan applied you need to wipe your palms and in-between your fingers using a cloth soaked in micellar water. Buff your knuckles on a dry towel to remove excess tanning solution," says Von Hep. For a quick fix, there's a pre-made tan eraser. Isle of Paradise's Tan Eraser and Tan-Luxe Glyco Water are two effective options. DiMarchi says to take a warm shower and exfoliate your hands afterward for the best results.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLS2tcOeZK2nXai9s63YZquapqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

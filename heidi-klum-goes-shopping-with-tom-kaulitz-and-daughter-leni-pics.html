The <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a>&nbsp;star was accompanied by her husband, <a href=#><strong>Tom Kaulitz</strong></a>, and her eldest kid, 15-year-old daughter Leni, as she was seen perusing the outdoor shopping market for vintage clothing and furniture.</p><p>The 46-year-old beauty was dressed super casually for the fun-filled shopping trip. Heidi was supporting her man’s former band as she donned a Tokio Hotel tour T-shirt, black sweatpants underneath a camouflage skirt and a denim shirt wrapped around her waist.</p><p>The&nbsp;Germany’s Next Top Model judge accessorized her stylish look with a pair of aviator sunglasses and an Escada handbag. Tom, on the other hand, sported a green shirt and black jeans, while Leni looked super cute in a white crop top and denim pants. What a trendy bunch!</p><p>During their outing, Heidi could be seen sipping on a large can of Mexican beer while she strolled around the Rose Bowl Flea Market. The couple’s outing comes just two months after they tied the knot in a <a href=#>romantic Italian ceremony</a> in August.</p><p>Prior to their wedding, the iconic supermodel — who actually <a href=#>married Tom in a private ceremony in February</a> — gushed about how excited her kids were to gain an amazing new stepdad. “The kids adore Tom. <a href=#>They can’t wait for the wedding</a>!” the brunette beauty&nbsp;shared with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-aesra-score=linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;>U.K.’s Closer magazine</a> in March. “They’ll be very involved in it all.”</p><p>Ever since Heidi and her rocker beau crossed paths&nbsp;on the set of Germany’s Next Top Model in February 2018, the Hollywood favorite has never been happier. In fact, the Germany native gushed about their incredible relationship last September.</p><p>“He is the kindest, sweetest, most caring, loving person. I feel so lucky. I don’t know the last time I was this happy in my life,” Heidi — who was previously married to ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Seal</strong></a> from 2005 to 2014, as well as<strong> Ric Pipino</strong> from 1997 to 2002 — told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-aesra-score=linkNewWindowWarning:1;>People</a> at the time. “He is absolutely wonderful. Maybe it is because he is German and we understand each other in a different way. But so far so good.”</p><p>Tom and Heidi are serious goals!</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to check out super cute pics from her family’s outing at the local flea market!&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hnKKcmWK4rcHMZp6onaNiwKm7z6mgp59drLa1tIytpqZlm5bCrbXTs2SappRisaLBxqGrnqpdobKvtYypoJyrXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

In 2023, the issuance of cat bonds rose by 8 per cent to a record high of US$15 billion globally, according to reinsurance firm Swiss Re.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the record figure signals investor interest and growing demand for catastrophe risk management, it is still far short of the scale of natural disaster-related losses. According to German reinsurance firm Munich Re, last year natural disasters cost the world US$250 billion.</p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The Asia-Pacific region</span></a> and Africa were among the most vulnerable, with only 12.5 per cent of losses being insured in 2023, well below the global average of 38 per cent. That number was even lower in China, with only about 5 per cent being covered by insurance.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong can do a lot to fill this gap,” said Cheung. He pointed to the city’s strong capital market, government support and financial infrastructure, all of which could develop its ILS market further.</p>In the budget announcement in February, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the government is keen to promote the development of ILS by establishing a dedicated regulatory regime and the launch of a pilot grant scheme <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">in 2021</span></a>. Since 2021, the city has raised US$562.5 million through four <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">cat bond issuances</span></a>. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/04/03/CLEAN-THUMB.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:33</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Strongest earthquake to hit Taiwan in 25 years leaves at least 7 dead, hundreds injured</p><p>Strongest earthquake to hit Taiwan in 25 years leaves at least 7 dead, hundreds injured</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the last such issuance was over a year ago by the World Bank, raising questions about the city’s efforts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The IA’s Cheung said that the government agency has been selective with issuances to achieve a long-term solution that can leverage the strength of Hong Kong to serve first the Greater Bay Area (GBA), and, if possible, the larger part of China and the region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are not just about boosting issuances – we’re talking about whether we can build a system,” Cheung said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/01/23/CLEAN-THUMB.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:51</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Scores trapped under rubble in China landslide, sparking evacuation of 500 in Yunnan province</p><p>Scores trapped under rubble in China landslide, sparking evacuation of 500 in Yunnan province</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The IA is in talks with various potential issuers, including international reinsurers, direct insurers and Chinese municipalities, according to Cheung. It is also networking and educating investors through conferences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheung said one reason behind the low insurance coverage for natural catastrophe risks is the lack of data. The IA is determined to discover more climate data within the GBA and Asia while developing modelling capabilities with universities in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The question is whether we discover the risks and make sure that the risks can be accumulated, packaged and put into an ILS,” Cheung said. “That’s where the ecosystem will work.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/03/22/clear.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">05:34</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Japanese cherry blossoms faced with the threat of climate change may disappear by 2100, study says</p><p>Japanese cherry blossoms faced with the threat of climate change may disappear by 2100, study says</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I believe we are going to have issuances every year from now on. We set our KPIs [key performance indicators] so that we should have regular issuances, but we have to work on more sponsors, different issuers and product types.”</p>Singapore, for example, has innovated in this area after two cybersecurity cat bond offerings last year. The city state also renewed its ILS grant scheme to support issuances covering longevity and mortality, according to the <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Monetary Authority of Singapore</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jorge Familiar, vice-president and treasurer of the World Bank, said that ILS is essential to disaster risk management and provides investors with asset diversification.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/03/07/clean_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:04</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Relative humidity hits 100% in southern China</p><p>Relative humidity hits 100% in southern China</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The asset return that insurance-linked securities provide to investors is related neither to interest rates nor to the behaviour of capital markets,” he said. “It’s an interesting instrument for providing diversification to a diversified portfolio of assets.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The World Bank’s cat bonds in Hong Kong last year secured Chile against financial risks brought about by earthquakes.

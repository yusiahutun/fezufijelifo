This could be as simple as walking around a corner in your home, following a circular path in a park or navigating any route that isn’t perfectly straight.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Curve walking demands better balance, coordination and cognitive input than straight walking, which is why it was the subject of the study.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you walk in a curve, your body has to adjust constantly to maintain balance and direction, integrating information from your vision, inner ear – which helps with balance – and muscles,” Ghoraani says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/01/3cc0128b-4e34-420a-b9d3-de1a28a0b6d2_9f27f3e7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Curve walking, then, may reflect changes in cognition, and so may help to flag early dementia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I am reminded now of how my mother began to list when walking, as if drifting off her path, long before she began to show signs of forgetfulness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gait changes can be subtle, Ghoraani says, and involve changes in walking speed, length of stride, and how much a person may sway from side to side.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These changes might be the result of normal ageing, but they can also signal underlying health issues, including those related to cognitive function, she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Is walking a miracle cure?

Dementia often leads to reduced physical activity, which can cause muscle weakness, particularly in the legs, making it challenging for people to lift their feet properly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the last months of her life, my mother stopped being able to walk unaided at all; she suddenly began to lean back as she walked and could only stay upright if somebody held her tightly by both hands – as if pulling her on skis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/01/8f1f0d88-7581-4e2a-a141-c96b42d431f1_d93a064d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This sudden change is a distressing situation associated with the advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Alzheimer’s progresses, Ghoraani says, it profoundly affects the brain’s ability to control motor functions and maintain posture, leading to severe difficulties with walking and standing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This neurological decline can happen abruptly, reflecting the disease’s unpredictable progression. I noticed this often during my mother’s illness – that her deterioration was not a steady decline downhill, rather it presented as a series of uneven and sudden steps.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Falls for elderly people can be serious.

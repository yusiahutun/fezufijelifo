Dee Dee, it is now believed, suffered from a mental disorder known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, which led to her subjecting her daughter to years of unnecessary and traumatic medical treatments. This included using a wheelchair and getting two salivary glands removed, according to Gypsy Rose.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Arnold Schwarzenegger’s lesser-known son, Christopher</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I see Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s rapid rise to social media fame as a testament to the power of second chances and personal growth,” Nina Vargas, a celebrity and business strategist, said. “Her story of resilience and transformation has resonated with millions, showing that we’re all capable of change and redemption, no matter our past.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Where Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s story began</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/16/96438281-9e63-4bde-b295-baabefceee44_ff20a173.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gypsy Rose grew up in a pink house in Missouri with her mother Dee Dee. She had a tough start in life, with Dee Dee telling neighbours and doctors her daughter was suffering from multiple illnesses including leukaemia and muscular dystrophy, according to ABC News.</p>Hulu’s 2019 series <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The Act, starring Joey King</span></a> and Patricia Arquette, gave a dramatised retelling of the family’s story, and multiple documentaries have laid out what happened to Gypsy Rose in detail.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was given multiple medications every day, was administered liquidised food through a feeding tube, and was transported around in a wheelchair. Dee Dee also kept Gypsy Rose’s head shaved, telling her it would fall out anyway. Gypsy Rose’s teeth rotted and fell out, and the rest had to be extracted. She even had her salivary glands removed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/16/fa7d9197-a310-496c-ac09-2652d5f16032_6ef759db.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dee Dee constantly obsessed over her daughter’s care and smothered her to the point they shared the same bed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Behind closed doors Dee Dee was overbearing, but to the outside world, it was a different story.

Her tooth decay was a result of the strong medications she didn’t need. Her hair would grow back if it wasn’t cut away. She was also a lot older than Dee Dee was telling people she was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/16/3c33c183-9a0c-47de-aea6-c991a6c45c84_a5a859db.jpg>Dee Dee’s lies started making less sense to Gypsy Rose, who tried to escape several times but was always forced to come back home.

The theory is that Dee Dee was purposefully giving her daughter pills and medicines to create symptoms of diseases that she didn’t have, to get attention from doctors and her peers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/16/8dc345f7-964f-4d80-9252-c7045d15d7de_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gypsy Rose has given several interviews over the years about her incarceration, describing how trapped she felt while living with her mother. In one with People after her release, she said killing Dee Dee was an act of “panic” and “desperation” because she was facing yet another surgery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s not like I didn’t think about every other option besides murder,” she told the outlet. “I did.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who is Justin Bieber’s controversial dad, Jeremy?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In her first social media video on December 31, 2023, she thanked everyone who had supported her.

She currently has over nine million followers on TikTok, and eight million on Instagram. YouTubers are begging her to appear on their podcasts, and media outlets are scrabbling over each other to land an interview.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jessica Maddox, an assistant professor and researcher of social media and internet culture at The University of Alabama, said that Gypsy Rose’s story has long been a source of fascination, with documentaries, articles and television adaptations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She’s always been a bit of a sustained internet celebrity in this way, even when she’s been in prison,” Maddox said. “The social media landscape was ready for her when she was paroled.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People were rooting for her to succeed, Maddox said, because her story was so horrific.

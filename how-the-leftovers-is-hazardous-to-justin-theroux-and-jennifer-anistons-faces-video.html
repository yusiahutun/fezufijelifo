"She'll like it for about a month and then she's like, 'OK, you have to get rid of it.' And I'm like, 'No, I actually have to keep the beard now for the whole show; I can't just shave it off.' The first season I had to have stubble for the entire season, and that was torture for her."</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/78/o/2017/04/05/7835fe876e865c0aba8228d72821ace7_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Theroux's stunts and training for his character have been physically brutal at times, landing him in the emergency room every single season of this series. Alongside a broken finger and snapped tendon, Ellen also shared an image of Theroux's broken nose.</p><p>"I was doing a stunt with a guy...I was supposed to run him against an elevator, and he was supposed to move his arm when we hit," he said. "He didn't move his arm and he mashed me in the nose, and then my nose went up—then he dragged the fake gun across my face and it left a big scar."</p><p>When asked how he celebrated wife's Jennifer Aniston's 48th birthday, he said: "We went to Cabo San Lucas and sat in the sun. We threw a little party and had a piñata and gave her some gifts, and that was about it. Low-key."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3e845625-84fb-51da-8329-75874d9cfd26 data-container-ref=toofab:article:c3e29c05-629c-525e-8171-7d237482f5d0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7e/5by4/2017/02/20/7e8eb8a63e2e57018bc266c33f9260f0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Paris Hilton Is Dating 'Leftovers' Star Chris Zylka And Has 'Never Been Happier' (Video)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Theroux is also friends with Ellen's wife, Portia De Rossi, who gave the actor some helpful advice before he traveled down to her native country of Australia to film the final season.</p><p>"She was helpful, but then I got to Googling Australia, and you realize that everything there will kill you.

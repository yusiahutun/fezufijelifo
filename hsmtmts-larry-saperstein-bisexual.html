With lyrics including, "There's one thing you can expect from me and that's the unexpected," creators who use the song usually reveal something "unexpected" about themselves in their videos.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>In Saperstein's video, he's seen in bed as the song plays. Over his head, the words "plays a character with a girlfriend on TV" are superimposed, before he adds, "is bi irl."</p><p>After his reveal, Saperstein's followers celebrated the announcement in the comments -- and began to speculate that his on-screen character is bi too.</p><p>"BI KING PLS," wrote one popular comment. "Big Red is definitely bi too ... him and Ricky keep having those moments," read another. Wrote a third, "HAPPY PRIDE BESTIE ILY AND IMY"</p><p>Saperstein eventually responded to his followers -- and, specifically, those saying they already figured it out -- by writing, "lol the we been knew comments are savage but y'all are funny and ily."</p><p>On "HSMTMTS," Saperstein's character is in a romance with Julia Lester's Ashlyn Caswell. The show, however, has been praised for its queer representation -- with Frankie A. Rodriguez and Joe Serafini's Carlos and Seb romance at the center of the action. The two are also dating in real life.</p><p>New episodes of "HSMTMTS" drop Fridays on Disney+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j29maWpfncCuwMytqmakkae%2FunnSmqeeqqOpsqq6jJugrJ2oqq6tew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

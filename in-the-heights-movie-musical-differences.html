Yet even the most avid theater aficionados will be surprised by some of the major differences between the Jon M. Chu–directed film and the original Broadway musical, which was written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegría Hudes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The baseline plot of the movie is the same: In Washington Heights, a majority Latinx-neighborhood in New York City, a tight-knit community fights for their dreams while contending with the ways its area is changing. In both the film and musical versions, there’s Usnavi de la Vega, a bodega owner who longs to move back to the Dominican Republic; Sonny, his ambitious cousin who works alongside him at the store; and Vanessa, who aspires to move out of the neighborhood. Nina Rosario, who returns to the community after leaving Stanford University, also features prominently in both versions, as does her father, Kevin, who owns a taxi service, and her boyfriend, Benny, who aims to run his own business. And, of course, there would be neither an In the Heights musical nor film without Abuela Claudia, the matriarch of the community who began looking after Usnavi after his parents died.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, some parts of the original production don’t make it into the feature film. Nina’s mother, Camila, is written out of the movie, and there’s little to no contention between Benny and Kevin in the movie, unlike in the musical. Vanessa’s story also changes: On the screen, she has big dreams to be a fashion designer and isn’t struggling with her mother’s alcohol dependency, as she does in the musical.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For many viewers, In the Heights will <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2021/06/in-the-heights-fandango-poll-moviegoers-return-pandemic-1234771425/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=mark class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">mark</a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2021/06/in-the-heights-fandango-poll-moviegoers-return-pandemic-1234771425/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" their return to " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"> their return to </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2021/06/in-the-heights-fandango-poll-moviegoers-return-pandemic-1234771425/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2021/06/in-the-heights-fandango-poll-moviegoers-return-pandemic-1234771425/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=theater class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">theater</a> after a long hiatus. Whether you’ll be heading to the cinema or streaming from home, watch out for these major differences between the film and musical.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">There are fewer songs in the movie than in the musical.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though the In the Heights movie is more than two hours long, some songs didn’t make the cut. These songs include “Inútil (Useless),” a solo by Kevin about the difficulty of providing for his family, and “Sunrise,” a tune that involves Nina teaching Benny Spanish. “Hundreds of Stories,” a duet between Usnavi and Claudia, and “Enough” from Camila are also omitted.</p><img alt="in the heights" title="in the heights" width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rev-1-ith-trlr2-0005-high-res-jpeg-1623356470.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Warner Bros.

As Claudia recalls in the song “Paciencia y Fe (Patience and Faith),” moving to the States from Cuba was difficult and involved “sharing double beds, trying to catch a break, struggling with English,” and “scrubbing the whole of the Upper East Side” as a maid.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, the film tackles the country's immigration policy more explicitly. In the movie, Sonny discovers that it will be difficult, if not impossible, for him to attend college because he’s undocumented. In one scene, he and Nina attend a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) rally alongside esteemed journalist Maria Hinojosa, who has often reported on immigration issues. Usnavi also uses his earnings from a lottery win to help Sonny pay for a lawyer so he can begin the years-long process of becoming a U.S. citizen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Broadway musical does not tackle these issues, as it was released in 2008, years before former president Barack Obama announced DACA policy in 2012. “The movie gave me an opportunity to explore some things I didn’t get the chance to the first time around, so I really wanted to take advantage of that,” Hudes, who wrote the In the Heights screenplay, told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.broadway.com/buzz/197874/we-partied-with-the-in-the-heights-cast-and-learned-new-details-about-the-upcoming-movie/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Broadway.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Broadway.com</a><u>.</u></p><img alt="in the heights" title="in the heights" width=6000 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rev-1-ith-08670-high-res-jpeg-1623356534.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Warner Bros.</span><p>Anthony Ramos as Usnavi, Gregory Diaz IV as Sonny, and Leslie Grace as Nina Rosario.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Nina changes her mind about returning to Stanford University at different points in the musical and movie.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the musical, Nina returns home to Washington Heights after failing out of Stanford University, because she was working multiple jobs to afford tuition and lost her scholarship. Yet in the movie, Nina, who’s the first person in her family to go to college, initially decides to leave Stanford because she is discriminated against for being Latina. She reveals to her father that she was accused of stealing by a classmate and her parents, and was assumed to be part of the waitstaff at a formal event by wealthy attendees.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In both the movie and musical, Nina’s father, Kevin, sells his car service so that he can help Nina afford tuition, but Nina initially refuses to accept his help. In the film, she changes her mind after attending the DACA rally for Sonny and seeing him worry about obtaining an education without documentation, whereas in the stage version, she changes her mind after Abuela Claudia’s death. By the end of both the film and musical, Nina returns to Stanford.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">There’s more LGBTQ+ representation in the film.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Carla and Daniela, who work at the local salon together, are depicted as friends in the musical, the film shows their relationship as more romantic. In the movie, Carla, who’s played by Stephanie Beatriz, and Daniela, who’s portrayed by Daphne Rubin-Vega, are partners who live together.</p><img alt="in the heights" title="in the heights" width=2000 height=1333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-rev-1-ith-1623356598.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy Warner Bros.</span><p>Daphne Rubin-Vega as Daniela and Stephanie Beatriz as Carla.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">There's a significant difference in the film's mural that convinces Usnavi to stay in Washington Heights.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Usnavi has always dreamed of returning to the Dominican Republic and spends the majority of the film and musical plotting to do so, but in both versions he abandons this dream after seeing a mural by Graffiti Pete at the bodega. In the musical, Graffiti Pete paints a mural of Abuela Claudia, which reminds Usnavi of the relationships and community he has in Washington Heights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the film, however, Graffiti Pete paints a mural of a beach in the Dominican Republic, allowing Usnavi to have a piece of home in the bodega. Viewers are led to believe throughout the whole movie that Usnavi has left for the Dominican Republic, because it begins and ends with him telling his children a story on the beach. However, it is revealed at the end that Usnavi, who has since married Vanessa, is telling them the story of Washington Heights from his bodega, with the beach mural as the background several years later.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/5fcd680e-ef12-4a3f-89f9-341c272ab791_1604506599.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Gwen Aviles" title="Headshot of Gwen Aviles" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Gwen Aviles is a freelance journalist who writes about arts and culture, politics, education, and Latino communities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiemaG6bsDVaJhsbmZthXaCmGigp2WknbJutMSinqGso2K6sMLInmSmraOesKK4jJ2gn56Vp7Kvr8SsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

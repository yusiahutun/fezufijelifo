I'll sign whatever you want."</p><p id=e782v890w9O data-wc=46>Sofia's journey from modelling in Colombia, to securing a Pepsi commercial at 17, and later landing the role of Gloria Delgado-Pritchett on Modern Family, has seen her wealth surge. At the height of the show's popularity, she was reportedly making "$500,000 per episode," according to Forbes.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5qRTDzL-Wt data-wc=25>More recently, her role as a judge on America's Got Talent, her Walmart fashion line and her beauty brand 'Toty' further bolstered her net worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d9810b3dbd33-sofia-vergara-mirror-selfie.jpg><p id=ekpFYzTzsh7 data-wc=36>Joe, on the other hand, gained widespread popularity with his role in Magic Mike&nbsp;and its sequels. His versatility extends from acting in various popular movies and television shows to being a director, producer, and writer.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecb-Kkg1L1j data-wc=22>An avid Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast, he has also secured roles as a D&D writer, consultant, and ambassador, further diversifying his portfolio.</p><p id=e3xeqjadWVx data-wc=16>The soon-to-be-former couple's Beverly Hills mansion, listed for $18 million, is a potential point of contention.&nbsp;</p><p id=eC7CsI7iQcR data-wc=30>Originally priced at $19.6 million, the luxurious Italian-style villa boasts seven bedrooms, an 11-bathroom home, a full-size gym with a sauna, a 10-seat movie theatre, and a 3,000-bottle wine cellar.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/56f6d9754081-sofia-vergara-joe-manganiello-split.jpg><p id=e4QNOva4yXp data-wc=17>Sofia and Joe have purportedly purchased another property nearby, still under construction, though the specifics remain unknown.</p><p id=eB4ul2bLGIB data-wc=33>Another point of consideration in their separation could be their shared Chihuahua, Bubbles. Thanks to a 2019 California law change, judges can now consider the best interest of the pet in divorce cases.&nbsp;</p><p id=eIM5P_6EHQH data-wc=26>This could potentially lead to some debate over their beloved pooch. Despite the potential disputes, Sofia and Joe's prenup may make their separation a simpler process.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2f18cb86003b-sofia-vergara-swimsuit.jpg><p id=eR0qXW_c4AM data-wc=47>Divorce attorney Frederic J. Siegel, with no direct affiliation to Sofia and Joe's divorce proceedings, commented on their situation, suggesting that their prenuptial agreement likely entails a 'walkaway' clause. "So with a prenup — and without kids [together] — it becomes a much simpler case," Siegel shared.</p><p id=ezc1IBQGjCi data-wc=39>He further speculated that Sofia and Joe have already progressed in their divorce more than the public realizes. As he stated: "Usually when people make the announcement like they made yesterday, they’ve already done some of the preliminary work."</p><p id=eYbbvIvTHvoL data-wc=31>Pointing out the advantages of an amicable separation, Siegel added: "It really doesn’t serve anybody. They’ve got very nice careers. They don’t want to be airing their dirty laundry in public."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZm1xaGWBeXvIp6qinJViwLCyyJpkr52inK6zrYyapZ1lmqSybrnAp56appmaua270magq6eeYrCtrcNmaGlonZ65rbXOp2SpqpWjwrF7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Glossy or metallic finishes, and a big old mirror.</p><p>"If you're finishes you can bounce the light around and create a space with a sense of vastness in the smallest of spaces."</p><h2>Light bulb moments</h2><p>Abbas says it's also important to not neglect your lighting choice and go for function over form.</p><p>But there is one big mistake to avoid.</p><p>He warns against thinking of a light fixture as an after though and to avoid classic spotlights.</p><p>He said: "Bathroom design has ramped up in recent years and bathroom lighting has followed suit - which means there is plenty of choice when it comes to stunning pendants, striking wall lights and ambient mirror lighting."</p><h2>Li-NO</h2><p>If there is one absolute no no for your small bathroom it's lino on your floor.</p><p>Abbas says lino is a "a big no-no!".</p><p>Instead, he suggests, using some statement tiles for the small space like checkerboard tiles.</p><p>And for an extra tip he suggests using the same tiles from floor to ceiling.</p><p>He says: "Nothing ages a room more than dreaded vinyl flooring.</p><p>"In a small space, go for statement flooring.</p><p>"Checkerboard tiles is a classic for small bathrooms, or to create a sense of depth and space, go all out and use the same tiles from the floor up to the walls, and even around the bath."</p><p>And while wood used to be avoided in a bathroom, now you can get wood-effect tiles which Abbas says "not only look great but add to a timeless look."</p><p>He added: "The real beauty about decorating a small space is that it doesn't take much to create a luxurious finish, so go all out with an intricate floor."</p><h2>It's not all about paint</h2><p>Your bathroom walls don't have to be plain and bare with just a lick of paint on them.</p><p>Our experts say you can jazz up your walls to help transform the space.</p><p>Tim Dixon from <a aria-label="Beautiful Walls (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beautiful Walls</a> says wallpaper can be a good tool and he has a top tip to keep it lasting.</p><p>Tim said: "Paint can be boring.</p><p>"For an instant design update, go for a feature that will transform the look and feel of your bathroom.</p><p>"Sealing your wallpaper with a layer of decorator's varnish can seal it, protecting it from effects of the bathroom's humidity."</p><p>And again, Abbas recommends using tiles on the wall.</p><p>He adds: "Fluted tiles are having a REAL moment right now and look fantastic on walls.</p><p>"You can even get wood-effect fluted tiles to give that slatted wooden look.</p><p>"These tiles will instantly add a bit of wow, and are super easy to maintain and install."</p><p>But for those who want to keep it simple with just a paintbrush and a tin the way to go is with colour.</p><p>Victoria Yardley of <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Victory Colours</a> says bright and bold is the way to go.</p><p>She says: "While bathrooms can feel cold and clinical, bright colours and bold patterns will bring life to bathrooms."</p><h2>Don't ignore the fifth wall</h2><p>One part of the bathroom almost always neglected is the fifth wall: the ceiling.</p><p>Every bathroom, even the smallest of ones, has the extra wall to use as a blank canvas and change it from the crisp white paint we normally see.</p><p>Victoria says it offers another blank canvas to use to get creative.</p><p>She says: "Who wants to sit back and relax in the bath and stare up to a sheet of white?</p><p>"Channel the calming energy of blue, or harness the revitalising powers of a red hue.</p><p>"Or, why not paper it in a botanical, jungle print that you can truly get lost in."</p><h2>Heat it up</h2><p>We all want our bathrooms to be cosy but you could be making a very costly mistake.</p><p>Rob Nezard, MD of <a href=#>UK Radiators</a>, says you do not need to have both a radiator and a towel rail.</p><p>He says it makes your bathroom look cluttered and ends up costing you extra on your energy bills.</p><p>Rob says: "Not only does it take up space, but it can also look cluttered and could end up costing you extra money for the energy they both use.</p><p>"A good towel rail or towel radiator is ideal for a small bathroom.</p><p>"It can do everything you want and whatever your design scheme there'll be one to fit.</p><p>"Opt for a matte black to complement a monochromatic look, a Victorian style for more traditional bathrooms, or a brushed brass finish to match the latest trends."</p><p>And Rob suggests if you want warm towels all year round, it's good to invest in a dual-fuel rail which can run without having to fire up your central heating.</p><h2>Storage solutions</h2><p>It's important to not clutter up the floor if you're really struggling for space.</p><p>The experts suggest adding shelves in materials that will enhance your bathrooms theme be it an upcycled cabinet or separate shelves, you can use the walls to your advantage.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>You can also pop your loo rolls up there to stop excess clutter on your floors.</p><p>And if you have room, adding some trailing potted plants will add a touch of greenery to your small space.</p><img

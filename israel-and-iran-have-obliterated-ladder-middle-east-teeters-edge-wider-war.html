Kerr Carnegie Middle East Centre, a Beirut-based think tank.</p>For years, Iran’s reactions to Israel’s bombardment of its positions in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0"

data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">bombed Iran’s consulate</span></a> in Damascus on April 1, killing top Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) general Mohammad Reza Zahedi and six other ranking officers.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The embassy attack was seen as an assault on sovereign Iranian territory, which, if left unaddressed, could ultimately encourage direct Israeli attacks against Iran itself,” Yahya said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Iran’s response to Israel’s killing of IRGC officers on diplomatic premises “doesn’t just move the situation up the escalatory ladder – it obliterates the ladder”, said Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the US National Intelligence Council.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first-ever direct Iranian attack on Israel “shatters the previous conflict threshold in the long-running war between Israel and Iran, bringing it out of the shadows and into the light”, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What is clear is that this is the beginning of a new era, one in which Iran is willing to respond directly to Israeli attacks and in doing so risk retaliation against the Iranian homeland,” said Panikoff, who is the director of the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Iran said its decision to respond in such a dramatic manner to the Israeli air strike was meant to re-establish deterrence against such attacks against its sovereign interests and personnel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/18/303f4979-45c5-43e2-88b6-bca7a60ea58f_48775d6a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The direct and targeted strikes at Israel aimed at restoring Iranian deterrence also showed Tehran’s changed calculus and risk appetite,” according to a paper published by the British think tank Chatham House on Monday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It cautioned against the popular perception that the attack was a massive failure given the near-perfect rate of interceptions of Iranian drones and missiles by Israel’s layered missile defence architecture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Had Iran’s intent been to hurt Israel, it wouldn’t have violated a core principle of military operations – the element of surprise,” it said.</p>Tehran telegraphed <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">its intentions</span></a> to Washington and several Arab and European capitals and assured them that its strike would be relatively limited.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Indeed, had Iran sought to inflict serious pain on Israel, it would have incorporated a heavier dose of fast-flying and precision-guided ballistic missiles” as part of offensive tactics that would have “significantly challenged and possibly overwhelmed Israeli defences”, Chatham House said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Iran also would have integrated the significant combat power of its regional proxies, especially Lebanese Hezbollah, into its operation, “turning this into a real multi-front conflict and a nightmare for Israel”.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

e1346ty31">Timing might be also key to Iran’s thinking, it said.</p>“Aware that a broader direct escalation with Israel and between Israel and Hezbollah is on the horizon”, Tehran has further sought to accelerate the timeline, “calculating that any escalation is better played out in advance” of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">US presidential election</span></a> in November.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Israel’s attack on the Iranian consulate was representative of the new approach it has adopted against Iran and the broader Axis of Resistance since the Hamas attack last October “exposed that Israel’s previous strategy had failed to ensure its security”, Chatham House said. The Axis of Resistance refers to an informal coalition that includes Iran and its allies in Middle Eastern countries such as Syria and Lebanon against Israel, the US and others.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, Israel has been “strategically targeting key coordinating figures” of the Axis as well as Iranian assets and individuals across its borders, it observed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During that period, at least 18 members of the IRGC’s overseas arm, the Quds Force, have been killed, in addition to the seven killed in the Damascus embassy compound.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">US diplomatic intervention prevented Israel from launching pre-emptive strikes against Hezbollah immediately after the Hamas attack in October, primarily because Washington did not want to be sucked into a war that would almost certainly involve Iran.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

jail</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To reassure Israel, the US instead deployed an aircraft carrier task force to the Eastern Mediterranean, and alongside France has diplomatically engaged Hezbollah through Lebanese intermediaries in an attempt to secure an agreement preventing the outbreak of war with Israel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Israel and Hezbollah have since ramped up their tit-for-tat attacks in phases, with Israeli warplanes and drones striking ever further north into Lebanese air space to hit the militia’s command structure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hezbollah, meanwhile, has deployed increasingly powerful weapons and extended its attacks eastward to target Israeli forces occupying the neighbouring Golan Heights in Syria.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Israel has rejected most US entreaties to limit its military operations since October and did not forewarn Washington about its attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, according to multiple news reports in the US media.</p>“More worryingly, the embassy compound bombing could also have been an effort by Israeli Prime Minister <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Benjamin Netanyahu</span></a> to drag the US into a conflict with Iran,” said Michael Young, senior editor of the Carnegie Middle East Centre.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Analysts said Iran would feel obliged to come to the aid of Hezbollah because the destruction of the Lebanese militia would deprive it of its primary deterrent against an Israeli attack on Iranian soil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/04/15/clear-thumb.jpg>This would invariably result in intervention by the US and other Western military powers, as shown by their recent role in shooting down Iranian projectiles over Iraq, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Jordan</span></a>, Syria and the Red Sea before they could reach Israel.President <a class="euc41pk0

that such support would not be extended to a counterstrike against Iran, and emphasised Israel’s security dependence on the Western powers.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“To decisively weaken the Iranians and their nuclear programme are Israeli priorities,” Young said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Israel needed US participation in any bombing campaign against the Islamic Republic “for this to succeed, with the added hope that Iran’s leadership can be overthrown”, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Washington has repeatedly avoided this, preferring instead to manage the situation through the imposition of economic sanctions on Iran alongside the basing of substantial military forces in the Persian Gulf.</p>The sanctions were tightened to devastating “maximum pressure” levels in 2018, following the Americans’ unilateral withdrawal in the same year from a 2015 deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=#

Iran including the sabotage of nuclear facilities and the assassination of top scientists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Iran has responded to US and Israeli pressure by building new, better-protected nuclear facilities and accelerating the enrichment of uranium to levels close to weapons grade.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So a large-scale attack “risks Iran retaliating beyond hardening its facilities and accelerating its programme and could push Tehran to make the political decision that nuclear weapons are necessary to deter future attacks on its territory”, said Kelsey Davenport, director of non-proliferation for the Arms Control Association in Washington.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the event of an Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, “it would be possible and foreseeable to revise Iran’s nuclear doctrine and policies and deviate from the previously declared considerations” said Ahmad Haghtalab, the IRGC general in charge of security at the facilities, on Thursday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Iran would likely withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in this scenario, removing any obligation for it to allow inspections of its facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Davenport said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This would make it more difficult for the West to rally the international community to pressure Iran to refrain from building a nuclear arsenal and negotiating constraints on its programme.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even if the US were to agree to carry out military strikes, it would not completely obliterate Iran’s most secure nuclear facilities, and its programme would rebound within a few years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/18/07f909d8-617f-4273-bb70-14843c0280d3_dc31ac68.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Iran’s nuclear programme is too advanced and dispersed for the proliferation risk to be effectively neutralised by military strikes,” Davenport said. Tehran already has the necessary capabilities to build nuclear weapons and that knowledge “cannot be bombed away”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Striking Iran’s facilities now would set back the programme but those setbacks would be relatively short in duration,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the other hand, although Israel denies possessing nuclear weapons, it received uranium enrichment technology from France in 1957 and is believed by strategic weapons researchers to have built up an arsenal of 80 to 90 warheads deliverable by domestically developed ballistic missiles, US-supplied warplanes and German submarines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In its annual report on adherence and compliance with arms control, non-proliferation, and disarmament agreements and commitments, the US State Department on April 12 said Iran had continued to expand its uranium enrichment activities and stock of enriched uranium, including by further deploying advanced centrifuges.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile and the enrichment efficiency of its centrifuges are key factors in the amount of time the US assesses would be required for Iran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon should Iran decide to build one.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The US continues to assess that Iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities that we assess would be necessary to produce a testable nuclear device,” the State Department reported.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JqhnZ%2Bk2igrKqRmrlurc2dZKKqkaN6qa3VnmSompyewaa%2BwK2cnWWclrGlsdFmpKKclKGybrHArKtmrJWawaa%2B0macnZ%2BVYsSqsMSrZLCZog%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Surrounded by trees and nestled in the Italian mountains, the luxury spot My Arbor is an impressive hotel - with an even more impressive story behind it.</p><p id=eCarGzjpeUm data-wc=71>Close enough to the<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Plose ski resort</a> that the hotel can be declared ski in, ski out, the getaway was integral in saving tourism in the area - and bringing people from around the world to this glorious corner of the Dolomites that fuses Italian and Austrian culture for so much more than just ski season. So should<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;My Arbor be your next go-to destination?</a> Here’s what you need to know…</p><h2>My Arbor hotel: our first impressions</h2><p id=eeJ2nzxhIU_ data-wc=41>Before stepping a&nbsp;foot inside, My Arbor is already impressive. Its unusual architecture delivers on its name’s promise as a shelter among the trees, with long tree trunks propping up part of the structure in front of a spectacular mountain view.</p><p id=e2SObr_h3yY data-wc=47>Entering the lobby, the wide, polished tree trunk reception desk, bunches of fresh flowers, tree trunks descending from the ceiling as well as a handsome fire pit cement the idea that this is a return to nature - and creed that the hotel is deeply passionate about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d5a2af738cdd-my-arbor-hotel-z.jpg><h6><span><a aria-label="my arbor" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">BOOK MY ARBOR HERE</a></span></h6><p id=ePLKgEtB0rg4 data-wc=91>After a smooth check-in service accompanied by a selection of refreshing aperitifs in the spacious bar area, with stunning views and floor-to-ceiling glass windows, our things were taken to our beautiful, spacious room. With a comfy corner area against sheets of glass, a balcony facing the line of mountain tops and a shower lining the width of one wall, it feels like you can get all of the Instagram content you could ever need without stepping out of your room - but that was before we headed down to the spa!</p><h2>My Arbor rooms</h2><p id=e7wPnCttp_jh data-wc=97>So, what was the room like? As per the hotel’s five-star rating, it was immaculately clean, comfy and so quiet at night that you could hear a pin drop, with almost all of the amenities that you could require including a hair dryer, sewing kit, shampoo, body wash and basic bathroom supplies were available, and we wanted for very little during our stay. We also enjoyed the Bluetooth speakers in the bathroom, a welcome addition. Notably missing was an iron and ironing board in the bedroom - with the hotel offering an ironing service for a charge.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf4d5f926e0b-my-arbor-room-z.jpg><h2>What is My Arbor’s spa like?</h2><p id=ebV5MqK5FLG8 data-wc=93>The spa is a source of great pride for those behind this wondrous hotel, and it’s easy to see why. Taking up two floors, it boasts indoor and outdoor heated pools, a steam room, five saunas, two jacuzzis, a cold dip spring water pool and several relaxation rooms with wide comfy beds for those after some peace. The below floor - with many of the amenities, is 'no textiles', meaning that guests can don towels and nothing else on the floor - a common rule in Europe - no need to be bashful!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/25a3fcd9f176-spa-room-z.jpg><p id=eL_Ixv5Hou-4 data-wc=97>The hotel also offers a large range of massage experiences, and couldn’t be more highly recommended from our own experience having the 'balancing' massage. Everything from the masseuse to the music, bed and smells was designed for the guest’s ultimate comfort. The only issue I had was that the hotel, unfortunately, mixed up the time of my massage appointment, meaning that I missed the full 90-minute experience, but the spa managers quickly went to the effort to arrange a shorter massage session as per their availability and were very helpful - and it was a fantastic highlight.&nbsp;</p><p id=eqc9DgxiTrzH data-wc=19><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Planning a ski trip? Why Hotel Rosengarten in the heart of Madonna di Campiglio is the perfect getaway</a></strong></p><p id=eTPxGrhAz65c data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Morzine: An incredible family friendly ski resort in the French Alps</a></strong></p><p id=eXqnCn0dloF6 data-wc=55>Perhaps the most interesting - and slightly bizarre - part of the spa experience at My Arbor is the infusion sessions, in which every hour in the afternoon, you are invited to join a sauna experience where a sauna master uses snow enriched with essential oils to give you a uniquely relaxing and rejuvenating experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d3fbb76d4115-sauna-master-z.jpg><h2>My Arbor’s restaurant</h2><p id=ezrhkvK-4f3S data-wc=95>My Arbor’s informal, modern European classic-styled restaurant boasts of a warm, welcoming atmosphere with tentative waiters to hand for all of your needs, as well as a hugely impressive salad bar, a variety of different dining options every evening with a differently curated menu (which always included some of the same delicious staples, like the cheese dumpling in beef broth soup, a favourite of ours throughout the trip), and even some live entertainment. The staff couldn’t have been friendlier or more helpful and had answers to hand for all of our questions about the menu.</p><p id=eDOIDLNe3scY data-wc=38>The wine list was extensive - and you can also have a sneak peek at their extensive vino collection by the downstairs spa, where there is an incredible vault filled to the brim with a variety of vintages.</p><h2>Is My Arbor ski-in, ski-out?</h2><p id=eiAqfObnt-Z9 data-wc=56>My Arbor could be a destination simply for a wellness retreat - with yoga programmes available,&nbsp;but the idea of the hotel was originally thought up after the ski resort was threatening closure due to a lack of tourism - and the Italian government making quick work of offering space for hotels to encourage new guests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/424ece14a358-winter-arbor-z.jpg><p id=eSnPMLxJwubQ data-wc=63>The hotel certainly doesn’t shy away from its connections to the Plose resort and has spacious ski lockers. It is a mere ten-minute walk from the slopes - but could be defined as ski-in, ski-out in snowier times. However, our trip in March meant traipsing through some sludgy snow before reaching the bottom of the slopes in a short walk rather than skis.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFHPmuScIAlF data-wc=44>The resort also includes&nbsp;a very efficient ski rental store,<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Erwin Stricker Sports Service</a>, so guests can be suitably suited and booted within 15-20 minutes of leaving the resort for a day in the Dolomites with 50km of slopes on all different levels. Perfection.</p><p id=embEUk9WJB9h data-wc=52>For those who aren’t interested in skiing but would enjoy a day out in the area, there is also the very charming local town of Brixen just a stone’s throw from the resort. For those wanting to visit in the spring, they also celebrate a delightful <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Water Light Festival</a> in May. Enjoy!</p><h2>My Arbor prices</h2><p id=ekDTTqkVjCc6 data-wc=8>Prices: starts at Euro 225/per person half board.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqb%2BiwsSlZmtoYmh9dH6Qam1wa2RsfKrAwKWwZqWpYq6ju9FmqqitpJ16tcXRqKNmpKWtwrPFjKGmrZ2cYr%2Bmwsiermg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

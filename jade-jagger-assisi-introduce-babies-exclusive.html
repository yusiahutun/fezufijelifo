"It was quite peculiar that the pregnancies happened at the same time," Jade, who welcomed her third child, son Ray Emmanuel Fillary, four weeks after <a class=hm-link href=#>Assisi gave birth to daughter Ezra Key</a>, said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/87426d4e6e0e-hello1339jadeassisijagger-a.jpg><p id=eQRzCWa6aiBAd data-wc=121>"I can't help but have a sense of humour about it. But becoming a grandmother doesn't faze me or make me feel older. I don't feel like a grandmother, because the babies are so close in age it almost feels like they are brother and sister. It's been really great. We're lucky."&nbsp;And Jade tells <strong>HELLO!</strong> that the double baby joy has brought happiness to her Rolling Stones father <a class=hm-link href=#>Mick Jagger</a>&nbsp;in the wake of the tragic suicide of his girlfriend L'Wren Scott. "My dad loves babies," Jade said. "He's really good with them and is a big family man. He's been through a difficult time but it's been great to have two new babies in the family with the joy they bring."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c81ba84715bc-portada-revista-z.jpg><p id=eAii1t0Xjt61H data-wc=180>Jade also tells the magazine that she kept news of her pregnancy quiet for several weeks – for several reasons. "I waited for a few months before I told Assisi because I wanted to do all the tests and feel confident that everything was okay because at my age, that was important. I also didn't want to take away from Assisi and make her feel like I had stolen her moment. "And Assisi said she had never guessed her mother was pregnant again. "No, I didn't have any idea. I think when you're pregnant yourself, you think you're the centre of the universe. She was really supportive when I told her about me. She told me a bit later, when she was four months gone. I was shocked but it's amazing for her and Adrian to have a baby because they are so happy together. Ray is Adrian's first child and it's lovely. I'm so happy it has ended up this way.

Whether she hits the red carpet rocking a powerful ponytail or dons her long, brunette locks for a casual outing with 3-year-old <a href=#>son Eissa</a>, there’s no doubt the 53-year-old beauty has been serving hair inspiration for the last few decades.</p><p>When she was younger, Janet usually opted for the least possible change. As she appeared on The Jacksons in 1976 and on&nbsp;Diff’rent Strokes&nbsp;in 1978, the Hollywood beauty could be caught sporting her natural, black tresses.</p><p>During her rise to international superstardom years into her career, the Poetic Justice&nbsp;actress began to experiment with her looks. Around the mid-’80s, Janet showed off her gorgeous, curly locks as she would walk red carpets, appear on TV talk shows and more.</p><p>Considering the “When I Think of You” singer has been a Hollywood staple for the last 40 years, we’ve come to know and love Janet for her ever-changing sense of style and enviable fashion. Since she’s effortlessly learned to master any type of hairstyle, Janet previously revealed she’s <a href=#>been focusing on learning to love her body.</a></p><p>“I had to find something in my body that I loved, and that was difficult for me to do,” the beloved performer candidly revealed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">In Style</a> in September 2019. “At first, I couldn’t find anything. I would look in the mirror and start crying. I didn’t like that I was not attractive. I didn’t like anything about me.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Grammy Award</a> winner said she had to overcome some of her biggest insecurities before she realized she was beautiful. “I wound up falling in love with the small of my back,” she gushed. “And then from there, I found more things.”</p><p>Although discovering her beauty had to come within, Janet insisted her insecurities started to diminish as she began to age. “A lot of it has to do with experience, getting older,” she continued. “Understanding, realizing that there isn’t just one thing that is considered beautiful. Beautiful comes in all shapes, sizes and colors.”</p><p><b>Click through the gallery below to see Janet’s incredible hair evolution over the years!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jmKedpGK3oq%2FKrKanZaKarq15x5qgq2VhaH92hJdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Taylor Swift better watch out as the center has a lot more time on his hands now he’s retired from football.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Jason Kelce</a> had an emotional start to the week by <a href=# rel=nofollow>announcing he’s retiring the NFL</a>. After a successful long career with the Philadelphia Eagles, the center confirmed the news on Monday with a press conference. The tear-jerking statement included a tribute to his <a href=#>wife Kylie Kelce</a> as his nearest and dearest were there to support him in the audience. Brother <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> was clearly <a href=#>choking back tears hearing his brother</a> up there. But now he has a lot of spare time on his hands, we think Jason Kelce could get back into singing. He’s quite talented. So maybe he can be an opening act for his brother’s girlfriend <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, eh?</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-kelce-s-singing-clips-unearthed-after-eight-years>Jason Kelce’s singing clips unearthed after eight years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-2005160227-1024x683.jpg><p>We found the star singing on an old Sound Cloud upload – and his 34-year-old brother was proud of him as he shared it on social media years ago.</p><p>While Jason hasn’t confirmed he’s shifting his focus to singing after leaving the Kelce brothers’ football fame, it’s a choice for the <a href=#>celebrity</a>.</p><p>In 2016, Jason performed live on WXPN as part of Dan Reed’s Copy That segment.</p><p>And his pipes isn’t the only thing up his sleeve. He plays saxophone and guitar.</p><p>He told Reed he played sax in high school as part of the jazz band while growing up in Cleveland Heights.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-soundcloud wp-block-embed-soundcloud"></figure><p>“When I went off to college, I knew people in the dorm didn’t want to hear a saxophone going off,” Kelce explained. “So I taught myself to play guitar.”</p><p>And he loves <a href=#>music</a> where the writers tell a story, so he may be a huge <a href=#>Swiftie</a> at heart then. His favorite was Guy Clark.</p><p>Jason said: “What comes out of their mouth is a gritty poetry that you can’t find anywhere else.”</p><p>The dad-of-three then performed two songs on the airwaves, with his roommate Will Wendel joining him. He covered Jason Isbell’s ‘Cover Me Up’ and played an original song he wrote himself – Homes Change.</p><p>Listen to his own song below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-soundcloud wp-block-embed-soundcloud"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-keeping-to-the-popular-podcast-with-his-brother>He’s keeping to the popular podcast with his brother</h2><p>Although there are rumors stirring he could go into broadcasting, with claims he’s talking with ESPN and Fox over potential opportunities, Jason is keeping quiet on his plans.</p><p>But one thing is for sure, he’s not giving up his <a href=#>podcast, New Heights</a>, which he does with Trav.</p><p>The brothers release episodes every Wednesday, and in their latest edition today they had a lot to talk about. From Jason’s big announcement, to jumping through fire onto a table – yep – to how he still really doesn’t want his wife to get a pet cat.</p><p>We’ll have to see if he loosens up on that last request.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WDcLbArKanZZuauaSxjJyYp2WWpLC2v4yopWagmah6tLXNoKCnn12prq2xza1kp6enYrWmeceaqmaln6eybsDIppxmp55itaq%2FjKGYp5yjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

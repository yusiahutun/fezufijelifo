In this episode of Go To Bed With Me, Im walks us through her "Korean-inspired" nighttime skin routine.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Jenn's Routine<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Normally it's ten steps, but since I'm traveling I minimized it to seven," she says. "Minimalism is great."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">First up is a makeup removing oil-based cleanser from Clinique. "It is well-loved, I have scooped a lot out of it," she notes. "It melts everything off. At first it feels weird to rub this all up in your business. I swear it won't break you out, it just removed everything and melts everything away."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After rinsing the balm off, she moves on to another cleanser. "K-beauty is all about double cleansing. It's just a fancy word for saying you wash your face twice," she says, reaching for a jelly ball cleanser from Bliss. "It's really fun to sue, you put it over hot water and lather this baby up and put it on your face."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After patting her skin dry, Im likes to layer on two products from SK-II, the lotion and essence. "This is basically a toner. I am just going to pat it on my face, it balances all the ph levels on your skin," she says as applying the lotion. "And don't forget your neck."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The SK-II Essence Im called her "holy grail" of beauty. "Essences put the amino acids and other things good for your skin back into your face," Im notes. "You want to make a pool of it in your hand and immediately slather it all over your skin and it's going to drink it all up."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then comes a redness-reducing and calming serum from Dr. Jart. "I like to just put one of these drops and apply it on my face. It smells so good, it smells like Tiger Balm. It's very cooling and it reminds me of my mom. I feel like my mom is here," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The last two steps are all about hydration. She uses a travel size La Mer cream to "lock all the products we put on our face and seal the deal" and the Sisley Eye Contour cream which she says is "very thick" and helps prevent wrinkles.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">The Best Sheet Masks for Every Skin Need</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt='strongTatcha/strong Luminous Deep Hydration Lifting Mask, $28, a target="_blank" href="http://www.tatcha.com/shop/deep-hydration-lifting-mask-1?gclid=CNW80a6mq8YCFYU9gQodGCEJzw"tatcha.com/a.' src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/15/26/hbz-charting-sheet-masks-02_1.jpg title=Moisturize width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3RnmaaamJqfnqCkGxmo52eo3qquYysoqKmk5a%2FpnnRqKytoZ6afA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

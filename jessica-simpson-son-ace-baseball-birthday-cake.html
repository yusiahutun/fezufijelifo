I cannot believe my boy is 7! This kiddo is amazing at everything!" Jessica gushes in the caption. After listing all of his qualities, including being "daddy’s best friend, mommy’s snuggle monster, home run king", the doting mum continued by joking, "I love you more than you love Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Ken Griffey Jr., Jackie Robinson, Bo Jackson, Frank Thomas, Wade Boggs, Nolan Ryan, Stan The Man Musial and Dad!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d735127fab25-jessica-simpson-cake-z.jpg><p id=eyoHTzLDbEF- data-wc=10><strong>Jessica revealed Ace also had cupcakes and several exciting presents&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eYFKTvDaZpUG data-wc=60>And fans rushed to the comments section to send Ace birthday messages and note his epic cake, with one writing, "That hug, that cake."

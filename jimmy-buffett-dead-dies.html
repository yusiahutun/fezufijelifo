While no cause of death has been revealed, a statement posted to his website says he died on Friday night (Sept. 1), surrounded by loved ones.</p><p>“Jimmy passed away peacefully on the night of September 1st surrounded by his family, friends, music and dogs,” the <a href=#>message</a> reads. “He lived his life like a song till the very last breath and will be missed beyond measure by so many.”</p><p>The "Margaritaville" singer was <a href=#>hospitalized</a> earlier this year while in Boston, Mass., in May. He <a href=#>joked</a> at the time that "growing old is not for sissies," but promised his fans he would be back on the road when he was well.</p><p>Before being discharged, he updated his fans on social media, but he didn't go into details on his condition.</p><p>"Once I am in shape, we will look at the whens and wheres of shows. I think playing is as therapeutic for me as it is for fans to listen and sing along," he <a href=#>wrote</a> at the time. "Looking forward to announcing a new date for Charleston as well as some new shows! Fins up!"</p><p>Buffett's songs created an escape for his fans, who could get away on a little mental vacation&nbsp;— even just for a few minutes&nbsp;— while listening to his music. This beach bum lifestyle expanded beyond music. His signature song, "Margaritaville," expanded into an entire brand that included hotels, casinos, restaurants and even a cruise ship.</p><p>Specifics about a service or public memorial have not been shared. Buffett is survived by his wife, Jane, and his children, Savannah, Sarah and Cameron.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>R.I.P: Remembering Country Stars Who Died in 2023</h2><p>Take a moment to remember the country artists, songwriters and other industry members we've lost in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo6GdosZurtSfnZ6spGKxpq3DZpuinaNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

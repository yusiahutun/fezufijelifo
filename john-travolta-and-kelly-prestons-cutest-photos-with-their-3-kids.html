The beloved Jerry Maguire actress <a href=#>died following a two-year battle with breast cancer in July 2020</a>, but the couple’s most loving memories have been captured forever in their sweetest family photos.</p><p>The <a href=#>Grease</a> alum and Kelly tied the knot in 1991. Just one year into their marriage, the longtime couple welcomed their eldest son, Jett, in April 1992. John and Kelly expanded their family when daughter Ella Bleu arrived almost eight years later in April 2000.</p><p>Tragically, Jett died at age 16 after suffering a seizure during a family vacation in the Bahamas in January 2009. The Pulp Fiction actor candidly opened up about the devastation they endured following the death of their child. “It’s the worst thing that’s ever happened in my life,” he once told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. “The truth is, I didn’t know if I was going to make it.”</p><p>John and Kelly welcomed their youngest son, Benjamin, in November 2010. Although Jett’s death left a hole in the pair’s heart, the Golden Globe winner <a href=#>credited Ben for being “a beautiful kind of glue</a> for us to re-bond after a tremendous loss,” he once told <a href=#>Good Morning America</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/john-travolta-and-kelly-prestons-cutest-photos-with-their-3-kids12.jpg><p>Ben’s birth may have been a wonderful surprise to fans, but the Twins actress revealed they were always hoping to welcome another child. “We had been trying for quite a few years, and then, of course, there was a time when we weren’t, and then we started trying again,” the doting mom told <a href=#>Health</a> magazine in August 2011.</p><p>“When I found out I was pregnant, I was floored,” Kelly sweetly continued at the time. “I’d snuck out of bed and then came back and woke Johnny up in bed. We both started crying. It was wonderful.”</p><p>Shortly after John revealed the news of his wife’s death, the duo’s eldest daughter shared a touching tribute to commemorate her mother’s memorable journey. “I have never met anyone as courageous, strong, beautiful and loving as you,” Ella emotionally <a href=#>penned</a> alongside a throwback photo of Kelly. “Anyone who is lucky enough to have known you or to have ever been in your presence will agree that you have a glow and a light that never ceases to shine and that makes anyone around you feel instantly happy. Thank you for being there for me no matter what.”</p><p>“Thank you for your love,” the gorgeous teenager went on. “Thank you for your help and thank you for making this world a better place. You have made life so beautiful and I know you will continue to do so always. I love you so much, mama.”</p><p><strong>To see John and Kelly’s sweetest photos with their three kids over the years, scroll through the gallery below.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jpqGmXam%2FosLOpauaZZGjsW63xKWjsmWgp7K0wM6nqmabpamytMCMqZ%2BorJ%2Boeri106FkraCVnr9uf4ykoJ2rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

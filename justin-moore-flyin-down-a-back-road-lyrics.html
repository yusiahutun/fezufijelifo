"They wanna know that opening up for <a href=#>Alan Jackson</a> still gets you excited." The first two verses are focused on the unbelievable experiences he's had since signing a record deal three years ago.&nbsp;"I've been on the Grand Ole Opry / I've played a show with <a href=#>ZZ Top</a> / Went on tour with <a href=#>Skynyrd</a> / And man they still rock," he sings before bridging to the chorus.</p><p>"And all that stuff it makes you feel real good / But not near as good / As flying down a back road / With some buddies from back home ... Spottin' deer in the hay field / After church, a Sunday meal / Hugging mama before I go / Flying down a back road."</p><p>Jeremy Stover and Jeremy Paulin co-wrote the song with Moore when the three rented a lake house during a rare few days off two years ago.&nbsp;"We've all been buddies for awhile," Moore shares, "and we remember not having one hit on the radio, now we've run a few together. Talking about all the things that I've been able to do, that just kind of makes me scratch my head. That's kind of where this thing came from."</p><p>The easygoing ballad feels like a thank you note of sorts, especially during the lyrics in the bridge to the final chorus: "I'm a lucky man, I've got a real good life / With all the things I've done, nothing gets me as high."</p><p>Moore says the song is being considered as a possible radio single, but agrees that autobiographical songs often don't make smash hits. Once again, he's found a formula for a great singalong at his concerts.</p><p>Taste of Country will be exploring the lyrics of each of the 13 tracks on Justin Moore's new album, leading up to the release date on June 21.

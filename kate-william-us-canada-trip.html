Kate and <span>Prince William</span> will visit Alberta during tour to North America which coincides with the opening of the <span>Calgary Stampede</span>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e95747810ec2-kate-middleton-z.jpg><p id=elfBIW3UOFdB data-wc=59>At the event, which bills itself as 'The Greatest Outdoor Show On Earth', the couple will have the chance to see bucking broncos (below), wagon racing and generally soak up the festival atmosphere. The newlyweds will visit at least nine cities and travel more than 14,000 miles in 11 days during <span>their first official tour</span> together.&nbsp;</p><p id=eP4rM1lkkIO data-wc=88>It runs from June 30 to July 10, and royal sources say the Prince and his wife are "very much looking forward" to it. Also on the schedule is a brief visit to Hollywood as part of a three-day visit to California, where they will promote some of the charities William is involved with. Officials have been keen play down suggestions that the couple will meet stars during their trip to Tinseltown. "The visit to California is very much about promoting charities," said a St James's Palace spokesman.</p><p id=e5lo1bSAUS data-wc=68>However, no one would raise an eyebrow if they met up with celebrity friends of theirs such <a class=hm-link href=#>Elton John</a> and the <a class=hm-link href=#>Beckhams</a>, who attended their nuptials. <a class=hm-link href=#>Guy Ritchie</a>,&nbsp;another of their wedding guests, is also currently in Los Angeles with his pregnant girlfriend Jacqui Ainsley. A prime chance for mingling with the stars will also come if&nbsp;William attends a BAFTA function in his capacity as its president.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4606184a0572-calgary-stampede-z.jpg><p id=eM9EVCk_iJ33 data-wc=84>It's also highly likely the couple will meet up with William's cousin Lord Freddie Windsor, who lives in LA with his actress wife Sophie. Before their time in California, the couple will spend nine days in Canada, where they will visit the remote settlement of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories. And Kate is, no doubt, looking forward a stop at Prince Edward Island, on the Atlantic coast (below). This was the setting of - one of her favourite childhood books.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_Lym18zHW1 data-wc=121>With her well-known attention to the details, Kate knows she has a chance to charm locals in the francophone province of Quebec by speaking some words in their language. So just as she <span>learned the words to the Welsh national anthem</span> for her first engagement, the Duchess is busy brushing up on her French. No doubt she'll be helped by her husband, who is fluent – as are <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Charles</a> and the <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen</a>. That isn't the only preparation the Duchess will have to do. There is the sizeable task of planning her wardrobe. It's estimated she will need at least 40 outfits for the tour, most of which she will pick out in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7e60364752b3-prince-edward-island-z.jpg><p id=emR4AHb5Ohj6 data-wc=157>For this, she can call on the advice of her mother Carole, sister <a class=hm-link href=#>Pippa</a> and Private secretary to the Princes, Helen Asprey. The selection of clothes is likely to include several High Street numbers from her favourite brands such as Reiss and Issa as well as some designer outfits. She may also want to include some local US or Canadian designers. According to the Palace, Kate has not decided if she will take a stylist or a lady in waiting. Both would perform useful duties – unpacking and packing, ironing her clothes, holding flowers she is given, and keeping the conversation flowing in a crowded room while people wait for a chance to chat with the royal visitors. The Duchess' reluctance to hire staff does have logic behind it, however. As one friend told : "The more you embrace the trappings of royalty, the more people expect from you – and you can't reverse it."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

She grew up in a neighborhood in northern Manhattan called Washington Heights, USA. Her parents, who were heavily fond of sports,&nbsp; shifted to the USA from India in 1981 which led to Kavitha’s subsequent interest in sports. As disclosed earlier, Kavitha completed her school education in Manhattan and later pursued Journalism at Columbia University. Moreover, she acquired a diploma in the area of City Research, Historical Past, and Political Science.</p><h3>Kavitha Davidson Career</h3><p>Kavitha always had a command of English. She decided that she wanted to pursue journalism and thus, went to Columbia University to work for the campus newspaper. While pursuing her course, a subject called ‘Socio-Historical Foundation of American Sports’ grabbed her attention and so, she started working as an intern for sports analytics, advertising, etc for Nielsen. She even worked on media communications for the Staten Island Yankees. After her education, she started working as a sports editor for Columbia Day by Day Spectator in 2008. After that, a columnist at ESPN and Bloomberg focused on the intersection of sports, business, culture, race, and gender.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u529fcd71e942e55f1b116f459fd72370><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Hannah Brown Biography</span></a><p>Moreover, she was also a co-host of The Lead( The Athletic’s podcast).

When she reported on late developments in the ‘Penn State University child sexual abuse scandal’, she received rape threats. Overwhelmed by the reactions, she bravely came out to the media as a victim of child abuse. Not much is cited except that she was just 17 when raped by a 45-year-old man. Taking a stance, she wanted other victims to come out and be held responsible for their actions.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Kavitha Davidson Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Kavitha A.

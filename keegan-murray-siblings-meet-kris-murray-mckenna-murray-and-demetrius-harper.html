He was named after dad Kenyon’s college teammate Chris Street, who was tragically killed in a car accident.</p><p>The twins attended Prairie High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 2019 and eventually went to DME Academy, a post-graduate basketball school in Daytona Beach, Florida. They then got scholarship offers from Iowa and played for the Hawkeyes. Kris was a sophomore on the 2021-22 roster.</p><p>Speaking about raising the boys, Michelle told The Gazette: “I’m so grateful God chose us to raise them. We spent a lot of time with the kids, reading to them. We had flashcards we did with them all the time. I taught them sign language when they were little.</p><p>“We would have a family movie night, family game night. We just loved being together and we appreciated the times we could be together. We’ve always had a calmness in our home.”</p><p>Keegan Murray also has a younger sister, McKenna, who plays basketball at Prairie.</p><p>The Murrays also adopted Demetrius Harper seven years ago. Demetrius was a star athlete at Prairie at the time and went on to play college football at Coe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKOVmrSiuoymrKuqka56tLXBpaCnn6Niuqax02aiq6GjYrq2vtGasGalk6Cyr7rAZqSuqqKWxm6tzZ1knZ2dmsGztdSsZKGZoqWys3uLZWNlZFxh</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

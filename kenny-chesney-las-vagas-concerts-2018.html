"Some years, we do the Keg in the Keys. But this year, I thought we should do something different. Rather than the last-minute announce and scramble, go ahead and set the dates, and announce them early. We've had such a great relationship with the Joint, that room puts everybody right in the heart of the show&nbsp;â€” and there's so much great rock & roll history at the Hard Rock, I thought it would be a great place to kick off the year."</p><p><strong>You Think You Know Kenny Chesney?</strong></p><p>Chesney previously performed during the Joint's opening weekend along with Paul McCartney and the Strokes. After a break from performing last year, the singer is ready to get back on the stage.</p><p>"A year without playing makes me want to get out there and I've been thinking about the tour, what we're going to do for months," he states. "But even more than what's on the screens, or how we're going to do the sound and lighting this year, the idea of getting to hear the No Shoes Nation sing these songs drives me to do all of this... and so rather than waiting for Tampa, we're going to Vegas for a little party."</p><p>For details and tickets to Chesney's Las Vegas show and his 2018 tour dates, visit <a href=#>kennychesney.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Country Tour Dates?

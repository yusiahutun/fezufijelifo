For some, pain medication isn't even needed.</p><p>Kim opened up to <strong>toofab</strong> about her post-surgery recovery, saying she believes her lack of pain was nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>“I never really had very much pain at all – and when I saw what I looked like on camera I was like 'I look so bad' but I just never had much pain," she says. "I kept it iced, but the pain never really happened, it never really hurt. I was just very relaxed. I didn't even have very much bruising."</p><p>Richards added, "He [Dr. Grigoryants] would say I might have some pain and bruising the next day and it just never came, almost like a miracle -- a blessing from above. I just didn't have that experience [like everyone else]. He does them every day and said he's never seen anything like this before. My bandage even fell off because there was no swelling. I just did everything he told me to do prior."</p><p>While Kim left the look and shape of her nose in the hands of Dr. Grigoryants (with only the desire to have her bump removed), other clients of the well-known plastic surgeon will often request a nose similar to some of our favorite celebs.</p><p>"They will bring me a photo of<strong> Kim Kardashian's</strong> nose and <strong>Angelina Jolie's</strong> nose -- they're the most frequently requested. You know, there's a lot of things they have to keep in mind ... you may not have the most beautiful nose but if it's a beautiful face, the nose makes a difference," Dr. Grigoryants told us.</p><p>But realistically speaking, the Dr. noted that you can't take someone's nose and expect to replicate that exact look on your face.</p><p>Dr. Grigoryants also told us that the most important factor (obviously besides Board Certification) is to find a surgeon who has a lot of experience.</p><p>"If I wanted plastic surgery myself or for my relatives, I would want somebody who does a lot of procedures. I would want a surgeon who does a lot of rhinoplasties and has a lot of experience. It's a more predictable outcome," he told us.</p><p>Click "Launch Gallery" above to see more "Housewives" who've been under the knife!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnR7j2xma2pfoLauedGimqGZopnAbrrOrJxmop%2BXerG0zq2mrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

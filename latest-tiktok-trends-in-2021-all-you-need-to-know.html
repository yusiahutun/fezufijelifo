With the development of technology, taking photos has become a hobby for many of us. Now we can take great ones even with our smartphones.</p><p>But is great enough?</p><p>For those who are not satisfied with great and aspire to be outstanding, following this trend is a must. Just grab your phone and push the creative limits of photography by playing with shadow and light or creating different compositions with unusual objects.</p><a title=@jordi.koalitic href=#>@jordi.koalitic</a><p>PHONE x MIRROR üì±Rate this from 1-10 üëÜüèº IG @jordi.koalitic for more üì∏ <a title=art href=#>#art</a> <a title=photography href=#>#photography</a> <a title=behindthescenes href=#>#behindthescenes</a> <a title=shotoniphone href=#>#shotoniphone</a> <a title=jordikoalitic href=#>#jordikoalitic</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a></p><p><a title="‚ô¨ Sweater Weather - The Neighbourhood" href=#>‚ô¨ Sweater Weather ‚Äì The Neighbourhood</a></p><h2>This or That?</h2><p>It‚Äôs no secret that we are all quite bored at home in quarantine time. If you have finished doing all the puzzles and took the last sip of your dalgona coffee, it is challenge time. All you need is your best friends and a phone. Unlike the classic party game this or that, this time you have to act instead of talking.</p><a title=@kyliejenner href=#>@kyliejenner</a><p>i‚Äôm still a supermodel on the inside</p><p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Alexandra Karadimas" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Alexandra Karadimas</a></p><h2>Perfect Ingredients</h2><p>We are used to cooking videos and quick recipes. However, food may not be the only thing that has recipes. What if God also created humans with such a recipe? And what if God was distracted for a moment? This 2021 TikTok Trend seeks answers.</p><a title=@sammiefarrall href=#>@sammiefarrall</a><p>God did a little spill <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foru href=#>#foru</a> <a title=sister href=#>#sister</a> <a title=twin href=#>#twin</a> <a title=MakeTheLeap href=#>#MakeTheLeap</a> <a title=UltraSmoothMoves href=#>#UltraSmoothMoves</a> <a title=AfterMyCoffee href=#>#AfterMyCoffee</a> <a title=godmakingme href=#>#godmakingme</a> <a title=godmakingmechallenge href=#>#godmakingmechallenge</a> <a title=funny href=#>#funny</a> <a title=siblings href=#>#siblings</a></p><p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Sammie Farrall" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Sammie Farrall</a></p><h2>Recreation of Childhood Photos</h2><p>Don‚Äôt we all miss being a little kid sometimes? We know that you want to go back to those times, especially when you look at old photos. A little nostalgia won‚Äôt hurt anyone. If you want to see what time has changed, don‚Äôt forget to follow this trend.</p><a title=@lance210 href=#>@lance210</a><p>Remaking our baby photos ü§£ @xosabrinanicolexo</p><p><a title="‚ô¨ I'm Just a Kid - Simple Plan" href=#>‚ô¨ I‚Äôm Just a Kid ‚Äì Simple Plan</a></p><h2>Misunderstood Words</h2><p>Word games and puns are not new at all. But it seems they still remain popular somehow. Misunderstandings continue to make people laugh. Taking advantage of the polymorphism of words or similarities in pronunciation can be a simple yet powerful base for a creative TikTok.</p><a title=@lizemopetey href=#>@lizemopetey</a><p>is this too soon‚Ä¶?

Almost every member has at least one transformation video. It looks like we love to watch how things change! Whether it‚Äôs a make-up transformation or a balcony transformation, it‚Äôs interesting to watch things change from the original. Impressive music matches and a smooth transition are the key points for the transformation videos to reach high views.</p><a title=@plastique_tiara href=#>@plastique_tiara</a><p>Feeling marvelous üëÑThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel inspired this look! @amazonprimevideo <a title=themarvelousmrsmaisel href=#>#themarvelousmrsmaisel</a> <a title=primevideo href=#>#primevideo</a> <a title=apvcreator href=#>#apvcreator</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Amazon Prime Video" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Amazon Prime Video</a></p><h2>Rating Random Things</h2><p>If there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs for sure, it‚Äôs that people love to voice their opinions. Where there are people, there are also opinions. On TikTok, it is possible to give an opinion about almost anything. If you‚Äôve been told you have an opinion about everything, wait until you explore this trend. You may not even have enough.</p><p>One of the simplest ways to express your opinion about something is to compare it with other things. People have been doing this for centuries, but some things never get old. I am talking about the good old rating game. Better start thinking about your own rating video right now because in TikTok there are a lot of them. The reaction of people when they hug you, the homes of celebrities, the food your friends cook, people you don‚Äôt know. Even the items your mother threw at you. Yes, this has already been done. This is truly among our favourite 2021 TikTok trends.</p><a title=@mynamespau href=#>@mynamespau</a><p><a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><p><a title="‚ô¨ Rating - astuanta" href=#>‚ô¨ Rating ‚Äì astuanta</a></p><h2>Reactions</h2><p>Another TikTok trend we come across as much as the transformation videos is reaction videos. In fact, it would not be wrong to say that reaction videos have been popular for a long time. Remember the Prank videos. Their whole thing was the reaction people gave to pranks. Those videos evolved, changed, transformed and became reaction videos.</p><p>We cannot go without saying that there are a few things to be aware of while shooting these videos. First of all, make sure that the reaction is genuine. People have become adept at distinguishing between genuine and false reactions. The second thing is‚Ä¶ Be careful not to make people angry‚Ä¶ This is one of those TikTok trends where your personality can shine!</p><a title=@nothatallee href=#>@nothatallee</a><p>He‚Äôs lucky he planned this with my best friend üíÄüòÇ <a title=wrongname href=#>#WrongName</a> <a title=couple href=#>#Couple</a> <a title=coupleschallenge href=#>#coupleschallenge</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=4yp href=#>#4yp</a></p><p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Natalie üå∫" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Natalie üå∫</a></p><h2>See More with This TikTok Trend: Behind the Scenes</h2><p>At first glance, TikTok videos seem very easy to shoot and flawless. But the reality is a little more complicated. Shooting these videos actually takes a lot of time and effort. Fortunately, people also love to watch this process. Just as a magician‚Äôs tricks are wondered, people wonder how the illusions in TikTok videos are made. Behind-the-scenes videos are the perfect content for revealing the secrets of these mysterious tricks that people have always wondered about.</p><a title=@youneszarou href=#>@youneszarou</a><p>Behind the scenes <a title=yzfamily href=#>#yzfamily</a> <a title=tutorial href=#>#tutorial</a> <a title=f√ºrdich href=#>#f√ºrdich</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><p><a title="‚ô¨ Originalton - YZ" href=#>‚ô¨ Originalton ‚Äì YZ</a></p><h2>Parents Impersonating Their Kids</h2><p>In this trend that takes empathy to a whole new level, parents imitate their child‚Äôs annoying actions. Soon the roles were reversed, the children began to imitate their parents. Following this, the trend spread further and this time the spouses started imitating each other. If you really want to know what it feels like to be in someone else‚Äôs shoes, you have to catch up with this trend that turns the world upside down.</p><a title=@champagneshanty href=#>@champagneshanty</a><p>My dad being me for a day</p><p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Laur" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Laur</a></p><h2>These are the 2021 TikTok trends!</h2><p><strong>Which of these 2021 TikTok trends do you think you can pull off?

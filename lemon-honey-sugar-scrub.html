That being said, now more than ever we want our skin to look its best, but unsightly marks and bumps might still be looming. Luckily, you don’t have to spend a ton of money on expensive beauty products to get the glowing, radiant skin you want. In fact, this brightening honey and lemon sugar scrub can be made right in your kitchen — and you can use it for both your face and body!</p><p>Lemon juice is known as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>potent skin brightener</a> for dark spots. It’s considered an astringent, which means it cleanses the skin and helps to reduce breakouts that are caused by excess oil — something that’s really important as we start sweating more in the heat! Not only that, but lemon juice contains high amounts of <a href=#>vitamin C</a> which is a powerful skin lightener. So if you’ve got dark marks from breakouts or razor bumps that you’re looking to get rid of, lemon juice can help.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p><a href=#>Honey is a humectant</a> that helps your skin retain moisture, which will counteract the drying effect of the lemon juice without causing your skin to break out. The moisturizing effect of the honey will give your skin a beautiful glow. Sugar in this scrub helps to <a href=#>slough off dead cells</a> to reveal fresh, smooth skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, a little bit of<a href=#> coconut oil</a> goes a long way. Coconut oil has anti-inflammatory properties which help to reduce redness and the appearance of breakouts, and it also protects&nbsp;the skin from bacteria and even (to a mild degree) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun damage</a>!&nbsp;It’s the perfect ingredient for summer skin care.</p><p>To make our DIY lemon-honey sugar scrub, follow the instructions below.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ingredients</h2><ul><li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li><li>4 Tbsp. coconut oil</li><li>3 tsp. Honey</li><li>3 tsp. Lemon juice (can sub 10 drops lemon essential oil instead)</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Instructions</h2><li>Melt the coconut oil in a small microwavable dish.&nbsp;</li><li>Add in the rest of the ingredients and stir well.&nbsp;</li><li>Perform a test patch on your skin to ensure that there are no adverse reactions. Once you feel safe, use your sugar scrub in the shower on any affected areas.</li><li>Rinse off with warm water.&nbsp;</li><p>You can use this sugar scrub daily for best results. Stop any use of this scrub if you start to notice skin irritation. Otherwise, include it in your routine at least twice a week to notice visibly brighter, smoother skin.</p><p>Here’s to a glowing summer season!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJomZ6ZpanGcLjEpqanZZiku6bFjKysoJmiYsCkvtSb</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

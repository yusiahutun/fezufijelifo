While each of the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>12 zodiac signs</a>&nbsp;has its M.O., signs that fall under the same element share similar perspectives and mirror one another in terms of what they value and how they move through the world. Knowing which element rules your sign can give you insight into your personality and desires — and help you figure out which signs you'll be most compatible with.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let's start with air signs. From your extremely personable BFF who throws the best parties to that intellectually stimulating romantic interest only up for an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>open situationship</a>, your world wouldn't be nearly as interesting without air signs. People who have air sign placements tend to be among the most curious, social, and humanitarian of the zodiac.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for your complete guide to air signs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-elements></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What You Need to Know About the Elements</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are three signs per element.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gemini</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Libra</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Aquarius</a>&nbsp;comprises the air group. Within each element, there's one of each quality — cardinal, fixed, and mutable. The quality that a sign falls under speaks to the sign's basic energy. Cardinal signs are the initiators of the zodiac (but can struggle with follow-through); fixed signs tend to be the most resolute (but also stubborn); and mutable signs are the most adaptable (but also wishy-washy).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Compared to air signs,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>water signs</a>&nbsp;are very much in their feelings.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Earth signs</a>&nbsp;are the pragmatists of the zodiac.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Fire signs</a>&nbsp;are action-oriented, while air signs are generally focused on interpersonal and intellectual pursuits.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-air-sign-traits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Air Sign Traits</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At times idiosyncratic and changeable, air signs can't help but be connectors. Their social networks tend to be vast, and they're innately driven to gather and share information. They are research-savvy and personable. They often find success through articulating and sharing their ideas — which are often futuristic, humanitarian, and progressive — in an engaging, mentally-charged way. However, because all their cerebral activity and airiness can impinge on being grounded, they'll usually get the best results if they have a specific endgame to pour their mental energy into.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</span></h3><ul id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Symbol:&nbsp;</strong>The Twins</li><li><strong>Ruling House:&nbsp;</strong>Third House of Communication</li><li><strong>Ruling Planet:</strong>&nbsp;Mercury, the planet of communication, transportation, and technology</li><li><strong>Compatibility:</strong>&nbsp;Gemini often hits it off with a similar social, flirtatious Libra, people-loving Aquarius, or dynamic Leo.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first air sign of the zodiac (and third sign overall), Geminis are buzzy, information-gathering sprites in human form and generally bring the most exciting air energy to the table. The Twins are perpetually curious, enthusiastic, clever, quick-witted, inquisitive, and friendly. As the mutable air sign, they're also flexible and free-spirited — but might have a bit of trouble with commitment and decision-making. They're known for their ability to initiate and engage in animated, lively conversation, jet off on impromptu trips near and far, and bring fun-loving vibes — whether they're at a party or a meeting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given Mercury's influence, the expressive Gemini can't help but adore data, research, and trending social media topics. They have a nearly insatiable appetite for discussing it all with anyone and everyone. In general, topics and areas of life of interest to them involve the Third House, which covers how we connect with others. This includes language, technology, early environment and childhood, sibling bonds, community, and short-distance travel. So, it'd be no surprise to meet a Gemini who's a reporter, an English or preschool teacher, or IT specialist.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Libra (September 23-October 22)</span></h3><ul id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Symbol:&nbsp;</strong>The Scales</li><li><strong>Ruling House:&nbsp;</strong>Seventh House of Partnership</li><li><strong>Ruling Planet:</strong>&nbsp;Venus, the planet of love, beauty, and money</li><li><strong>Compatibility:</strong>&nbsp;Libra often connects best with flirty Gemini, people-loving, intellectual Aquarius, or fun-loving Leo.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The second air sign of the zodiac (and the seventh sign overall) is the harmony-seeking Libra. The social butterflies whose hearts are drawn to art, music, dance, and connecting with others. They're the cardinal sign of the air bunch, so they tend to dream up and get the ball rolling on big, sweeping, wide-ranging visions. They're especially drawn to pursuits of justice and bringing more beauty and equity into any situation. They tend to be on a lifelong mission to make life more romantic, conflict-free, and fair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fueled by&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Venus</a>, the planet of love and beauty, Libras are the designers, party planners, couples therapists, and lawmakers of the zodiac. They're eager to take any blank space or messy situation and make it more aesthetically appealing and — yep, you guessed it — balanced. They're also go-to mediators with a knack for tackling and smoothing over tension in relationships. While Libras are undoubtedly people-people, one-on-one relationships are truly Libra's forte — particularly with a long-term partner or spouse but also with friends, business partners, and loved ones.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Aquarius (January 20-February 18)</span></h3><ul id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Symbol:</strong>&nbsp;The Water Bearer</li><li><strong>Ruling House:&nbsp;</strong>11th House of Networking</li><li><strong>Ruling Planet:</strong>&nbsp;Uranus, the planet of rebellion</li><li><strong>Compatibility:&nbsp;</strong>They're most compatible with similarly social, mentally-charged Geminis, hosts with the most Libras, or free-spirited Sagittarians.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The third air sign of the zodiac — and 11th sign overall — Aquarians are free-spirited, eccentric, and deeply committed to working toward what's best for the greater good as opposed to the individual. They're science- and future-minded, independent, and personable — especially adept at appealing to and maintaining a diverse network of connections. Informed by their ruler, electrifying Uranus, they're masters of coming up with innovative — and, at times, quirky — ideas and stunning breakthroughs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This fixed air sign often makes a wonderful scientist, community organizer, activist, or nonprofit founder. Aquarius is committed to questioning and perhaps outright rejecting the status quo. Their appetite for the community is also inspiring, as is their tendency to question, think, mull, explore, and experiment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their desire to prioritize communal needs over self and to be comfortable and magnetic in a large group of friends or colleagues goes hand-in-hand with their rulership of the 11th House. This covers groups of all kinds — those you form with friends, colleagues, neighbors, and other members of your political party. It also speaks to wishes, destiny, and hope, and the aspirations covered here are often those you'll achieve through collaboration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unvAoqlmq5mcu7Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

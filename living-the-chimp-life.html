<span class=val><a href=./categories/blog>blog</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>Living the Chimp Life</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p class=p1>On a serene 150 acres in Fort Pierce, there’s an entire subcolony of residents hiding in plain sight. They spend their days much like we do: snacking, napping, engaging in hobbies (called “enrichment activities”), and hanging out with their friends. Their world is quite full and active, though most humans aren’t even aware these Treasure Coast locals are living nearby. The community here has one rule to becoming a member resident: You must be a chimpanzee.</p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Currently, 227 chimps live here at <a href=# rel=noopener>Save the Chimps</a> sanctuary, where they are free to roam about and just be, well, chimps. They live in family groups on 12 separate islands within the property, each home separated by reeds and water- ways to give the groups some privacy. On a recent </span>visit, <span class=s2>the members of one clan were playful, chasing each other around and climbing on their wooden structures, while those in another family were lazily having a snooze.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Save the Chimps was cofounded in 1997 by anthropologist Carole Noon, a graduate of FAU and the University of Florida who sued the U.S. Air Force to gain custody of 21 chimps who had endured harsh conditions in the name of research. Along with Jon Stryker of the Arcus Foundation (who is currently board chair of Save the Chimps; Noon passed away in 2009), she purchased the Fort Pierce land, built a sanctuary, and moved the chimpanzees in.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Since then, the nonprofit has taken in more than 330 animals who were facing exploitation and endangerment. Some have come from the entertainment industry; others were freed from research labs—like the 266 chimps who were transferred to Save the Chimps by the Coulston Foundation over the course of a decade. Coulston was a biomedical research lab in New Mexico that had violated the Animal Welfare Act and was going bankrupt. Save the Chimps stepped in and, by 2011, had moved every single chimp to Fort Pierce.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>At the sanctuary, these animals are experiencing a life they had been denied for years, if not their entire lives. They are able to roam free, live in groups, and be the social creatures they were born to be. Supported by 50 caregivers, 45 volunteers, and a seven-member medical team, they have climbing structures to play on, lush environs to explore, and enrichment activities like painting and food foraging challenges</span> <span class=s1>to keep them mentally stimulated. They receive lifelong, comprehensive medical care (the average life span of a chimp is 40-60 years) and are fed a nutritious and delicious diet. Aside from chimp staples like bananas, oranges, and corn, they are treated to special meals like their favorite stuffed peppers</span> <span class=s1>prepared by the onsite chef, commissary supervisor Josh Henderson.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Like humans, chimpanzees can be choosy when it comes to friends. So when a chimp first arrives at the sanctuary, the behavioral team assesses the personality and needs of the new resident to gauge which of the 12 clans is the best fit, taking into consideration the leadership styles of the family alphas. For those who have trouble vibing with other chimps, there is a special needs facility where they can reside until they have developed the social skills to live in a large family group while getting the special care they need and participating in playdates with other chimps.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>On these pages, we offer a peek inside the lives of these incredible animals. If you’re inspired by their stories and would like to help support their care, you can “adopt” a chimp (for as little as $60 a year) or donate any amount you are able via the website.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/Tammy-Melody-and-Janice-hang-out-on-their-familys-wooden-climbing-structure.-Photography-by-Mark-Cook-1024x683.jpg><p class=p1>Tammy, Melody, and Janice hang out on their family’s wooden climbing structure. Tammy, 39, was born at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, where her parents had been living in captivity since the 1960s for use in space research. After almost two decades spent as a research animal, she arrived at Save the Chimps in 2001. She is a bit silly and full of energy and likes to eat mixed nuts and dried fruit. Melody, 15, was actually born at the sanctuary, the result of her dad’s failed vasectomy. Luckily, she has never had to endure the suffering of isolation or medical experimentation. She loves to play with toys and do enrichment activities involving peanut butter. Janice, 24, was born at the Coulston Foundation and endured years of experiments at their lab, then at a lab in Maryland, and at yet another lab in Louisiana. After a long battle, Save the Chimps finally gained custody of her in 2007, when Janice was 8. She is very intelligent, and one of her favorite hobbies is spreading colorful paint on canvases, floors, and walls.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/Lisa-Marie.-Photography-by-Mark-Cook-683x1024.jpg alt="Lisa Marie.

There, he was injected with the hepatitis A virus as the subject of numerous medical studies and had part of his liver removed. He did not see the outdoors for 14 years, became depressed, and was self-harming. By the time he was rescued by Save the Chimps in 2003, he was extremely traumatized, and rehabilitation took five years (he didn’t even know how to do normal “chimp things” like climb when he first arrived). Today, Ryan is confident, social, and loves painting, exploring and climbing!</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/Spike-chimp-at-Save-the-Chimps-at-Fort-Pierce.-Photography-by-Mark-Cook-683x1024.jpg alt="Spike, chimp at Save the Chimps at Fort Pierce.

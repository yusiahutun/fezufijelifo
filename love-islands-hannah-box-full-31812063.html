She added: "I've got so much more to come from there, I'm going to keep doing posts about it because people are curious and like to see it. So, in going to share some more definitely."</p><p>"But some are too much for social media, 100% yeah, because at the parties it was 'lingerie or less' so there's loads.

The TV star explained what a normal day there would be like for her and said: "We would go out either to the game house or the gym in the mansion and we would go really early like maybe eight o'clock we'd have to be there. We would get body painted all day whil a massive party like the most like dramatic party you've ever seen would be getting set up in the back garden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>"We were fully nude but it looked like we had clothes on. And then basically when Hef would make his appearance and he would walk down the red carpet for E! channel or whatever. We would just line up with him to do the press. Then we'd go to the party like it. It was actually nuts. I actually felt like I had clothes on though, it was so weird."</p><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters</b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#> <b><u>here</u></b> </a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLmwwsRmoKykkaOxtHnHmqWnmZhir7DEjJ%2BspaRdaH55fZFpbWw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

In July, she openly talked about her desire to settle down with Taylor during a chat with magazine. She said: "I would definitely get married again. My life has sort of taken unexpected twists and turns professionally and personally, but overall my journey is the reason I am here today and I feel fulfilled by everything that happened." She added: "'I'm definitely ready for motherhood sooner rather than later! I think that’s going to be the next chapter."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=e-J4SuOB0ejS data-wc=136>Mandy tied the knot with Ryan in 2009, just one month after getting engaged. The actress filed the divorce papers, stating "irreconcilable differences". At the time, an insider told : "She had been unhappy for a while. She tried to make things work and eventually she just had to walk away. She's trying to keep things civil." The actress, who has been busy working on her series s, recently revealed she would love to start a family. She told : "Sure, but I think that's probably just in line with where I am in my life right now. The chapters have sort of lined up pretty perfectly… It's certainly good practice because I want to be a mom one day. Working with babies and kids and everything in between."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

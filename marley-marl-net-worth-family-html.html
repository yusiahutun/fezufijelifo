His influence - both as a rap pioneer and sampling savant - stands second to none. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Touted as one of the genre's&nbsp;most significant producers ever, the Queens, New York-native played an instrumental role in helping&nbsp;Hip-Hop find mainstream success. No wonder, his name is so synonymous with&nbsp;the so-called "golden age" of rap.</p><p style=text-align:justify>For all his acclaim and critical success, Marley's work ethic slowed down at the turn of the century. Read along to learn about what he's doing now!&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Net Worth, Songs</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Born in 1962 in the housing project of New York City's Queens, Marley attended block parties as a teenager. Hip-Hop -&nbsp;still in its infancy at the time -&nbsp;captivated his ears. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Following an internship at the electro label Tuff City, he co-founded&nbsp;Cold Chillin'. By all means, operating Cold Chillin' was a family affair. With little assistance from his sister, he sought the rawest talent that New York had to offer.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Produced For:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Roxanne Shante Baby Father, Relationship, Parents, Net Worth</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Marley's production&nbsp;work on songs such as&nbsp;Roxanne Shante's classic&nbsp;Roxanne Revenge and MC Shan's The Bridge placed his imprint and the Juice Crew on the map. Collaborations&nbsp;with fellow New Yorkers Eric B & Rakhim and Heavy D helped build his resume. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>With Juice Crew's Biz Markie&nbsp;and Big Daddy Kane, Marley found unprecedented success. Outside of it, he scored his most significant crossover hit with LL Cool J's Mama Said Knock You Out.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Circa&nbsp;the mid-90s, Marley got embroiled in a legal quagmire over&nbsp;the songs produced by him. In 1998, the judge ruling over the case sided with him and he recieved the control of his discography.</p><p style=text-align:justify>With $5&nbsp;million in&nbsp;net worth, Marley is one of&nbsp;Hip-Hop's most commercially successful iconic producers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Where&nbsp;Is Marley Marl&nbsp;Now?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Considering Marley's fortune, it behooves for him to find a peace of mind by enjoying the life of a retiree. But no, he actively seeks ways to contribute to the&nbsp;culture that he helped build from the ground up.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The way Marley moves with his daily dealings doesn't&nbsp;garner the same level of media attention as his younger counterparts do. However, there is no denying that even now he lives and breathes Hip-Hop. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Another Legend From The Past:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Alex Ferguson Health, Hospital, Net Worth, Now</a></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Marley Marl with collaborator and pal Roxanne Shante in 2011</strong> (Photo:- Mari Koda's YouTube)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Together with&nbsp;longtime friend Roxanne Shante, Marley - now age 56 -&nbsp;co-hosts two hours long radio show on WBLS every Friday night. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Wife & Family</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The love for producing runs deep in Marley's family. Following on the producer's footsteps,&nbsp;his son - who runs under the moniker M. Will - released his project AsAbove/SoBelow in 2012.</p><p style=text-align:justify>M. Will's mother (and Marley's possible wife) remains a mystery figure.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Equally Secretive Family Man:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Big Boi Wife, Net Worth, Kids, Family Real Name</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>As someone who values his family's privacy the most, Marley rarely makes mention of his married life on the public platforms. However,&nbsp;during his 2013 NPR&nbsp;interview, he made an exception by crediting his ex-wife for helping him inspire the&nbsp;In Control Vol. 1&nbsp;photoshoot.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqaZoqGyunnMmqmlZZ6awW7DzquroWWWlrqquNhnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

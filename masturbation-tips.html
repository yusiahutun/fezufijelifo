While I, personally, and many women I know are well-acquainted with just how fantastic a good solo session can be, I also have a handful of lady friends who say they’ve never learned to pleasure themselves.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>In fact, I was so blown away when I learned that one of my close friends had gotten off with male partners, but had never given herself an orgasm that I decided to give her the gift of a personal vibrator. As useful as our hands can be, the assistance of a high-powered, <a href=# rel=noopener>well-designed vibrator</a> can definitely help you cross the finish line without the assistance of anyone else in your bed.</p><p>In celebration of the magical gift that is masturbation—thank you, nature, for not making <a href=# id=auto-tag_sex data-tag=sex>sex</a> exclusively about reproducing—we’re highlighting five very hot, very effective solo <a href=# rel=noopener>sex positions</a> that will give you plenty of pleasure when done right. Read on for tips and inspiration (along with a few helpful <a href=# rel=noopener>sex toys</a>), and then go ahead and clear your morning, afternoon, and/or evening for some well-deserved self-loving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bathtub-masturbation-1.jpg><p>For the uninitiated, here’s an important fact: Your <a href=# rel=noopener>clitoris is almost always the key to coming.</a> So light some candles, fill up the tub, lie back, and let the faucet run straight onto your clit. (Don’t have a tub? If you have a removable shower head, point the nozzle there instead.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/waterslyde-sex-toy.png><h2>Lovability Water Slyde Aquatic Stimulator</h2><p>This innovative <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">aquatic simulator</a> allows you to get even more stimulation from your faucet’s stream by channeling the water pressure and adding more pressure and buildup to heighten the experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/facedown-masturbation-1.jpg><p>The floor. Your bed. A couch. All you need for this position is a flat surface and your vibrator. Lying face down, use one hand to tuck the vibe between your legs and position it underneath you at a 45-degree angle (depending on the design and size of the device). Let gravity do the work for you as your weight against the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">vibrator</a> builds up enough friction to make you climax.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-20-at-11.53.19-AM.png><h2>Lelo Sona Cruise Clitoral Stimulator</h2><p>This <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">premium (and super chic) clitoral vibrator</a> pleasures the entire clitoral arena (many similar sex toys only offer targeted stimulation) with gentle wave motions that allow for multiple orgasms without causing irritation to the area. Plus, it’s super quiet and discreet, so you’ll never have to worry about practicing some self-love when the roommates are home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/grinding-pillow-copy-1.jpg><p>If you’re a fan of girl-on-top sex, you’ll love this solo version of the position. Grab a pillow with a clean case that you can wash later, roll or scrunch it up so that it’s not&nbsp;too soft underneath you, and hold it there by straddling it. While this position can take a little longer because it’s a soft surface you’re grinding against, it can result in a heavenly drawn-out orgasm that’s just as good (or better) like the kind you’d get if that was a human under you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dame-pillo.jpg><h2>Dame Pillo</h2><p>You can use any pillow you have laying around to suit your fancy, but <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dame’s Pillo</a> is a bit more firm and you can also use it for heightened pleasure during intercourse with a partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sideways-solo-1.jpg><p>Lying on one side, use both hands—au natural or using a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">dildo or vibrator</a>—to stimulate your clit. This position is particularly conducive to watching porn while you get off (no neck strains here), and the weight of your top leg pressing down on your hands or toy can help add extra friction that can be key to reaching orgasm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08Block_Soraya_Wave_0.jpg><h2>LELO Soraya Wave</h2><p>This double-the-pleasure <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">rabbit vibrator</a> is designed with gentle yet powerful pulsating and vibrations to stimulate both the clitoral area as well as the G-spot. It’s a win-win. Plus, it’s currently on sale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/solo-crossed-missionary-1.jpg><p>Lie back, cross your legs, reach down and touch yourself to see what feels good. This position is great for beginners who are exploring what works best for their bodies—it’s not too intense, complicated, or intimidating. The crossed legs can help your hands or <a href=# rel=noopener>vibrator</a> stay in place once you’ve found the spot that feels good and having one arm thrown over your head can help you arch your back to put your pelvis at a more orgasm-friendly angle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DCGjV-NjL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><h2>Luna Personal Massager Vibrator</h2><p>This affordable, <a data-pmc-sp-product=0a803f184b8682eecfea91de50d1a0e3 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"multipurpose vibrator","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Ava Vibrator Wand Sex Toys [Clit Stimulator Vibrators] Vibrator for Woman | Sex Toy | Gifts for Women | 20 Patterns & 8 Speeds of Pleasure | Quiet & Small | Adult Sex Toys -Standard - Hot Pink","price":"21.97","id":"B07YVQC4DR","category":"Clitoral"},"id":718195,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>multipurpose vibrator</a> is the perfect accessory for the One-Hand-Wonder.

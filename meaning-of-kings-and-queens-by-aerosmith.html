The overall theme of the song centers around power, deceit, and the fleeting nature of life, all set against the backdrop of a medieval world ruled by kings and queens.One standout lyric that helps develop the theme is "Long ago in days untold, were ruled by Lords of greed." This lyric introduces the corrupt nature of the ruling class, emphasizing their insatiable desire for wealth and power. It highlights the disparity between the wealthy and the common people, setting the stage for the struggles that lie ahead.Another significant lyric is "Starch and parchment laid the laws when bishops took the ride." This speaks to the influence of religion in the medieval era, where the clergy held great power and authority. It suggests that even within the confines of the church, there were those who would deceive and manipulate to further their own agendas, contributing to the theme of deceit.The line "Tossing and turning, nightmares burning, dreams of swords in hand" evokes a sense of restlessness and the internal struggles faced by individuals living in this era. It reflects the constant conflicts and battles that were a part of everyday life, both literal and metaphorical. The dreams of swords in hand represent the desire for power, and the nightmares burning signify the consequences and loss that accompany it."Sailing ships, the Viking spits, the blood of father's land" introduces an unexpected theme of exploration and the longing for new horizons. It suggests that amidst the prevailing power struggles, there were those who dared to venture beyond their familiar territories, seeking new lands and opportunities. However, it also hints at the violent and brutal nature of these expeditions, as symbolized by the "blood of father's land."Overall, the song's lyrics combine elements of power, deceit, conflict, and exploration to create an intricate tapestry of medieval life and its inherent struggles. It presents a world where kings and queens wield great power, but often at the expense of their subjects. Within this framework, the song explores themes of corruption, the struggle for power, the consequences of deceit, and the allure of the unknown.Through its vivid and imaginative lyrics, 'Kings And Queens' transports listeners to a bygone era, allowing them to vicariously experience the complexities and contradictions of medieval life. It serves as a poignant reminder that the struggle for power and the deceit it can breed are not limited to any specific time period, but rather enduring elements of the human condition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyisdGoqqahpJ18rrHAp6Cnn12ks263yKeerGWRo7FuvdSenKerXZfGbq3Eq6aspZmptQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

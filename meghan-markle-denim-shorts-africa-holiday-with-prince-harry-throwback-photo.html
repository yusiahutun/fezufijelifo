I feel deeply connected to this place and to Africa."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">DID YOU HEAR?</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Prince Harry's surprise relocation comment on solo trip" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/aea905740dad-prince-harry-smiling.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Prince Harry's surprise relocation comment on solo trip" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Prince Harry's surprise relocation comment on solo trip</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8950d5c7c3f1-prince-harry-africa-trip-z.jpg><p id=eVi3BvgsFFV data-wc=66>Did you know that Meghan Markle's bespoke engagement ring features a natural diamond sourced from Botswana?

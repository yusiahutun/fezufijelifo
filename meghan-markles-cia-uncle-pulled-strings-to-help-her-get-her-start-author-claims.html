Meghan Markle’s CIA uncle apparently had to ‘pull some strings’ to get her the job, a royal author claims</strong>.</p><p>For millions of followers of <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>, her career path is a source of inspiration. She not only became the first person from her family to attend college but also made it big in her <a href=#>TV</a> career thanks to the fame of Suits. But before her stardom as an actress, Meghan had her fair share of odd jobs that she took up. This included a <a href=#>yogurt shop where she met a Baywatch star</a>. One of the roles was working as a press officer far away in<strong> </strong>Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-s-cia-uncle-pulled-strings-when-she-was-in-college>Meghan Markle’s ‘CIA uncle pulled strings’ when she was in college</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-937000624-1024x733.jpg><p><a href=#>Royal</a> author Andrew Morton claims in his book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess that her career had a kick-start. He alleges, that, thanks to Meghan Markle’s uncle – who reportedly worked for the CIA – made sure she had a great opportunity in college.</p><p>After attending Northwestern University, where Meghan studied international affairs and theater, the Duchess of Sussex was looking forward to a new chapter of her career.</p><p>Her uncle Mike Markle, who was employed as a specialist in communication systems for the US government, helped Meghan get a job.</p><p>“She approached him to ask for his help in getting her an internship abroad with the State Department,” Morton wrote.</p><p>“Meghan, I will help you if I can,’ he replied. Help her, he did. Uncle Mick pulled a few strings, and even though Meghan was quite late in submitting the application paperwork, that was overlooked because of her excellent academic record and her uncle’s influence.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-had-quite-the-adventure>Meghan had “quite the adventure”</h2><p>Right after graduating from college, the opportunity to work overseas was quite the adventure for twenty-year-old Meghan. Morton claims she was part of a team that included twenty-eight State Department officials and guards in the mid-sized American enclave.</p><p>The job opportunity was only for six weeks at the American Embassy. During her time, Meghan was warned about where to avoid, what to do in an emergency, and which telephone numbers to call.</p><p>“Basic but vital information,” Morton added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-uncle-claimed-she-left-us-behind>Meghan’s uncle claimed ‘she left us behind’</h2><p>Reports claim the same uncle who helped Meghan get a high-profile internship felt like she had ‘left’ them behind years later.</p><p>Before his death, Uncle Mike talked about the <a href=#>royal</a> situation. He said: “Meghan has climbed socially and left us behind — that’s how I feel.”</p><p>“I think that’s what happens when you’re “underclass” and trying to rise above the reality of your situation,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>.</p><p>“Coming from her background, she may have a chip on her shoulder.”</p><p>The Duchess never responded to the claims.</p><p>Mike died in July 2021, aged 82, from Parkinson’s Disease. He never met her husband <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and tensions didn’t appear to heal before he passed away.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aBcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y56qZpuZlnq2usKlnGaopaG5prCMrKuroZ6cwG7AzmafnqSgYrWmvoygnK1lmJq%2Fbr%2FTmqmtZZGqwam70WaapZmZosBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

"In the process, he ignored our mandate on remand regarding certain aggravating and mitigating factors. Finding in this unique case that double jeopardy principles do not bar a final proceeding, we thus vacate the sentence and remand for a new sentence to be imposed."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e540124f-58e9-54af-93ed-2d8191679263 data-container-ref=toofab:article:366344b4-2e13-4f03-9c8e-ac1235e88780 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/5by4/2019/12/11/331a3a1efe7b562b998b3f570a841335_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Melrose Place Mini-Reunion Talks Pool Fights, O.J.

"During this entire time she has done everything they've asked her to do, and it's difficult to explain to her two girls why five years later Mommy is being put back in prison."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:32ceac20-f0f0-521e-883e-e50332970208 data-container-ref=toofab:article:366344b4-2e13-4f03-9c8e-ac1235e88780 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/58/5by4/2020/03/30/58e2cef7844952cc8638c500438d4cae_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Heather Locklear Proves the '90s Are Alive and Well In Extremely Rare Instagram Video</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In 2017, Locane said she feared going back to prison after an appeals court claimed her most recent sentencing was too lenient.</p><p>"I had worked so hard since 2010 on my sobriety, on adjusting to life in prison, on being released from prison, on acclimating to my children’s lives, and to parole that having to go back would seriously interrupt, if not destroy, any progress I had made in becoming human again," the "School Ties" star told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New Jersey Advance Media</a>.</p><p>"There hasn't been a day that has gone by that I don't think of Helene Seeman," she continued. “"I feel terrible for her family. I know that they are hurting. I know that they are grieving. I have said that I'm sorry over and over to them, but I feel like it falls on deaf ears."</p><p>Locane first rose to fame opposite Johnny Depp in 1990's "Cry-Baby." She landed the role of Sandy on "Melrose Place" in 1992, but only appeared on the first 13 episodes.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?

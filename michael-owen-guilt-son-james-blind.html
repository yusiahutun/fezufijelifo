He has since been forced to give up his dream of becoming a professional footballer like his father due to his sight getting progressively worse throughout the years.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Michael Owen sought therapy over 'jealousy' of Love Island daughter Gemma and wife Louise's close bond" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3972d63b6dc6-michael-owen-daughter-gemma-owen-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Michael Owen sought therapy over 'jealousy' of Love Island daughter Gemma and wife Louise's close bond" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Michael Owen sought therapy over 'jealousy' of Love Island daughter Gemma and wife Louise's close bond</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Michael Owen recalls embarrassing moment he was told off by the Queen" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2903d439a53e-queen-michael-owen-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Michael Owen recalls embarrassing moment he was told off by the Queen" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Michael Owen recalls embarrassing moment he was told off by the Queen</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ehn57nbZrb data-wc=34>"But James was born that way, James doesn't know any different," added Michael.

The eye disease causes vision loss in children and young adults. Symptoms of the condition typically develop before the age of 20 and include a loss of detailed vision and colour perception, wavy vision, blind spots and blurriness.<br></p><p id=eyfU9wz29Z data-wc=58>Confessing that the family have been dealing with some time, Michael continued: "That's obviously horrible, but I've never sung it off the rooftops. We get on in life. James is 18 in a couple of weeks. We have a fantastic life together, it brings us closer, I have to drive him everywhere and I'm absolutely delighted about that.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoD3B4GjWX data-wc=49>He added: "We take the positives out of it. Of course you bring it to light in the public domain and everyone's like, 'Oh my word', but it's water off a duck's back for us. It's news to the world but we’ve been living with it a long time."&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Michael Owen reveals son James has a genetic condition which has left him blind</figure><p id=eMKxe-xIm3 data-wc=62>Asked whether he felt guilty about the things he would say to James before the diagnosis, the doting dad replied: "Absolutely. I couldn't understand why he wasn't looking at the camera straight. I'd get people come up to me and say, 'Just a little bit of advice for your son, when he shakes your hand, tell him to look in someone’s eye.'&nbsp;</p><p id=etqk6ps5OJ data-wc=27>"You always think to yourself, 'Shall I tell him?' No, I'll just leave it. I can't be bothered having the conversation and that happens to this day."&nbsp;</p><p id=eLZ04Cc7g- data-wc=53>Michael shares son James with his wife Louise, to whom he has been married to since 2005. The couple are also parents to Love Island star Gemma Owen, 20, as well as daughters Emily, 16, and Jessica, 14. James touched upon his upset when his hopes of becoming a professional footballer were dashed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d1f5d2e0cf6-michael-owen.jpg><p id=e0q95EMf5p data-wc=31>He said: "Everyone dreams of being a footballer when they're younger, so it was quite hard, especially with it being so close to home. It's something you have to get over."&nbsp;</p><p id=efAcEzSScV data-wc=43>Speaking about his dad's support, the teenager – who is now training with England’s Partially Sighted Futsal team - added: "He is a great dad, he definitely helped me through a lot of the hard times and understanding why I am this way.&nbsp;</p><p id=enjbJPW1Hv data-wc=27>"It's been a massive help and it's made me into the person I am today. I am a lot happier now.

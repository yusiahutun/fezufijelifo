The U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration approved it in 2010.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Scientists came up with the idea for cryolipolysis by studying what happens to fat during frostbite. Fat freezes at a higher temperature than skin. The cryolipolysis device cools your fat to a temperature that destroys it while leaving your skin and other tissues unharmed.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cryolipolysis isn't surgery and doesn't use needles. The device holds the part of your body your doctor wants to target between two paddles. The paddles cool quickly and your doctor leaves them in place for about 35 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes. During that time, the process destroys about 20%-25% of the fat cells in the area that's targeted.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The final results may not show up for a few months, but you may start to see some changes within a few weeks. Your immune system clears out the dead fat cells slowly over this time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold><span class=mol-style-italic>Information courtesy of webmd.com</span>&nbsp;</span></p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/tvshowbiz/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sims talked to Allure in 2015 about dropping weight with some help. 'First of all, it's really hard. You have the baby, you've never had a baby in your life and you're like, Oh, my God, what has happened? And you work out constantly and you try to eat well, and very slowly it comes off,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She added, 'It took me almost a year to get the weight off. And I was honest about that in my book The Everyday Supermodel...&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I realized that no amount of dieting or exercise was going to get that last bit off my belly.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'So I went to my derm, and I said, "Is there anything else I can do? I can't do any more sit-ups."&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And she was like, "Yeah, we have this new thing called CoolSculpting [a procedure that uses controlled cooling to freeze fat cells]."'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sims has been a spokeswoman for the treatment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The siren said it is a nonsurgical procedure that's FDA-cleared. It's not lipsuction, and does not require 'going under.' It takes an hour for each treatment.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I did my stomach, so I did two hours all at the same time. I saw results in a month. To tell the truth, [CoolSculpting] came to me. I wrote about it two years ago in my book because it really worked. I wasn't out to get an endorsement. I really did it.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also talked about taking care of herself: 'Schedule your time.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'People always ask, How do you do it all? I'm like a walking calendar.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I literally make my snacks on a Sunday if I'm traveling on a Tuesday, and I'll pack them before I leave.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Or I'll look at the menu of a restaurant we plan on going to beforehand, and I'll say, OK, we're getting tacos on Tuesday, so we're going meatless on Monday.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-80f4ddfb8b70dc6b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/04/06/16/41403426-9441171-New_look_On_Monday_the_star_also_posed_in_a_beige_crochet_one_pi-a-35_1617721967854.jpg height=793 width=634 alt="New look:&nbsp;On Monday the star also posed in a beige crochet Acacia one-piece swimsuit that dipped low on the sides" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>New look:&nbsp;On Monday the star also posed in a beige crochet Acacia one-piece swimsuit that dipped low on the sides</p><img id=i-d96578fb60a4f25a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/04/06/16/41403420-9441171-Dashing_doll_The_red_carpet_fixture_added_a_straw_hat_with_her_b-a-42_1617723270257.jpg height=791 width=633 alt="Dashing doll: The red carpet fixture added a straw hat with her blonde tresses tucked under while wearing chunky jewelry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Dashing doll: The red carpet fixture added a straw hat with her blonde tresses tucked under while wearing chunky jewelry</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She has celebrated getting older.</p><img id=i-b9cc87dea5dda5d2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/04/06/16/37456310-9441171-image-a-41_1617723270256.jpg height=415 width=305 alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span></span><p class=imageCaption>Her early days as a model: Sims flashed her tummy in this cover for Cosmopolitan&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In May she put on a party dress as she turned 47-years-old.&nbsp;Molly displayed her fabulous legs as she posed in the backyard wearing a flirty mini dress with heaps of gold jewelry.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Holding her decadent, gold-topped cake in her hands, Molly was a sight to behold as she flashed a radiant smile towards the camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's my birthday so I can get all dressed up if I want to .. to only take it off 5 minutes later,' Molly captioned the photo series, along with a devil, heart and cake emoji.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes!

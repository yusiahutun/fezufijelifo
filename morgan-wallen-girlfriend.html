Since you came into the world Friday, I see mine differently now,”&nbsp;he captioned an Instagram post announcing his birth. He told People about their<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/parents/morgan-wallen-coparents-son-kt-smith-someone-i-care-about/ rel=nofollow> co-parenting situation:</a> “Obviously we still saw each other some.” He told the publication that he’s thankful to share a son “with someone I care about. We’re doing our best to figure it out, just trying to do the best we can with the situation. I mean, many people have been in this situation before — having a kid with someone you’re not with — but knowing that doesn’t make it any easier.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/morgan-wallen-charges.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Morgan-Wallen.jpg><p>Smith and her new partner Luke Scornavacco went public with <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/morgan-wallen-last-night-lyrics/>their relationship</a> in May 2023.

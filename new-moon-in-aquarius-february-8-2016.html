While most of our solar system weighs heavy on the opposite side of your chart, the theme for your New Moon will be partnership and creating space for them. Let go of the beloved reins for now, because when you do, growth will occur. Perhaps you will both decide to explore new interests together. Single?

A New Moon in your own sign of Aquarius happens only once a year and it is your annual cosmic gift —&nbsp;an opportunity to rebirth your image.

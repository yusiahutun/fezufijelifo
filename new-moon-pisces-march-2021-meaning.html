Read on to get the lowdown.</span></p><p><span>Every month, we are gifted with the magic of a special day filled with the potential to maximize our manifestation powers. On this day, a new moon occurs when the sun and moon meet at the same exact place in the sky and the moon is hidden. It is often said that the best time to sow your seeds is when the sky is at its darkest</span>—literally, this <span>makes sense for farmers wanting to make it difficult for critters and insects to find their harvest (so they won’t eat it), but the same thought applies to our planted seeds of intention! And this is what the monthly new moon represents.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p><span>For this New Moon in <a href=# id=auto-tag_pisces data-tag=pisces>Pisces</a>, magnified by the presence of Neptune and Venus close by, we are encouraged to dream as big and bold as possible. It is also a time when the veil between reality and the world of spirit is at it’s thinnest, allowing us access to a deeper connection with the underlying forces of creation and that little voice within. This is why it’s imperative to listen closely to the emotions that come up, as well as pay attention to any vivid dreams you may have. Both will provide clues on how to proceed towards your goals.</span></p><p><span>If you want to take this energy to the next level, write down any goals, adventures or experiences you want to come your way. You can even light a candle to amplify this energy and further manifest your wishes. Once you’ve done <a href=#>this little ritual</a>, all that’s left is to be open to synchronicities and allow the universe to guide you towards your goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>No matter what sign you are, use this New Moon in Pisces to dust off all of those ideas that you deemed too large, too whimsical or too bold! </span><span>It’s time to remember that the only thing, person or circumstance standing between you and your wildest dreams is yourself. You can create any experience you want, but you have to dream it first. So use this new moon and dream bigger, bolder and more magically than ever before.</span></p><p><span>Although all signs will be affected by this new moon, Sagittarius, Gemini and Virgo will have a bit more navigating to do in order to gain the maximum benefits.

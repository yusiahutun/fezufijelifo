I want a big family too,” he said. “The Lord has blessed me with what I asked, but ask and you shall receive.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/why-mariah-carey-bryan-tanaka-break-up.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Nick-Cannon-1.jpg><p>With more than 10 children, Nick is super supportive of all of his kids and their mothers.

And we went in just to check his sinuses, and they actually said his sinuses were pretty cool, but by the time we found out that, he had another condition. And I think it was called, if I’m not mistaken, fluid that was building up in his head, and that was the cause [of] his head starting to get big. When we found out it was more, they called it a malignant tumor in his head. Immediately, he had to have surgery. Brain surgery.” He then praised Alyssa for her hard work as a mother. “Alyssa was just the strongest woman I have ever seen,” he said during the time. “Never had an argument, never was angry. She was emotional when she needed to be but was always the best mom and continues to be the best mom possible [to her daughter from a previous relationship].”</p><p>In honor of their late son, Nick and Alyssa created Zen’s Light foundation with the goal of helping to find a cure for pediatric cancer.</p><h2>Legendary Love Cannon</h2><p>Birthday: July 2022</p><p>Mom: Bre Tiesi</p><p>Legendary Love Cannon is Nick Cannon’s eighth child.

Cannon confirmed he was expecting baby No. 8 on an episode of The Nick Cannon Show in January earlier that year. “Everyone knows I have a lot of children. It’s never a competition. Each one is special,” he said.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News Daily Pop,</a> Tiesi opened up about her and Cannon’s relationship. &nbsp;“I just respect and love who he is so much as a person, that when I thought about, ‘Do I want my son to be this person? Look at your characteristics, look at your personality, look at how you treat people.’ That’s what is so much more important to me than anything. And he treats me amazing,&nbsp;so that’s all I look at.”</p><p>During the season debut of Selling Sunset’s seventh season, Tiesi shared about how she feels about her relationship with her son’s father, 16-month-old son Legendary with the former&nbsp;Wild N’ Out host. “I love Nick. I’m happy with my relationship, however that is, and like, if I date, I date,” she explained. When Emma Hernan asked whether Nick would mind if she dated other people, Tiesi responded simply, “I don’t know. Maybe.”</p><p>“Wait. You’ve got to be kidding me. That’s not fair,” Stause said. “I mean, I do what I want to do, but I still would never disrespect Nick. I just wouldn’t,’ Tiesi continued. “And even his situations and stuff, I’ve always been nothing but respectful of that. I know people don’t get it, and I don’t care that people don’t get it.”</p><p>“It’s kind of like a new age power position,” Stause added, which Tiesi agreed with. “You don’t need anything from anyone. Your child is obviously well taken care of. You’re not looking for, you know, any kind of hole to be filled. You’re fulfilling yourself.” “Well, maybe we could tell Chelsea that,” Tiesi quipped.</p><h2 id=onyx-ice-cole-cannon>Onyx Ice Cole Cannon</h2><p>Birthday: September 2022</p><p>Mom: LaNisha Cole</p><p>Onyx Ice Cole Cannon is Nick Cannon’s ninth child.

God has given me and&nbsp;@MissLanishaCole the privilege of hosting an Angel here on earth. I vow to protect, provide, guide and love this child to the best of my abilities.” He continued, “Hopefully I can teach Onyx the same, to not let others shame or ridicule her with their outside opinions, because when they do they are only projecting their own harsh experiences, pain and social programming onto her unblemished beauty. As we all know I am not easily triggered and have quite tough skin and have always been an open book but not everyone in my family has that same level of strength. So I pray and ask others to please project all criticism and cynicism towards ME and not the loving and precious Mothers of my children.”</p><h2>Rise Messiah Cannon</h2><p>Birthday: September 2022</p><p>Mom: Brittany Bell</p><p>Nick Cannon and Brittany Bell welcomed their third child together, and tenth Rise Messiah Cannon together on September 30, 2022.

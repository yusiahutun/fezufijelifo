Once a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lover of "It" accessories</a>, I keep it basic nowadays and only wear sentimental trinkets, like my wedding rings and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>few layering necklaces</a> I've worn for years. However, I've since come across a fancy-looking but inexpensive accessory that brings all the shine without the hassle: <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">NYC Sterling's Cubic Zirconia Tennis Necklace</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While once reserved for only the fanciest of occasions, this tennis necklace lookalike from Amazon isn't quite as precious as the real thing — it's made with rhodium plated brass and features cubic zirconia stones. I don't have to worry about it while I wear it every day with my sweats and athleisure at home, but it's also nice enough that I can pair it <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>with a cocktail dress for a wedding</a> or a night out. So far, the under-$40 necklace has proved to be indestructible: I've slept in it, showered in it, and yes, even played tennis in it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The best part? The faux tennis necklace I wear non-stop starts at just $33.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I tried four faux tennis necklaces on Amazon before falling in love with NYC Sterling Store's version. I found the round, three millimeter stones to be the most realistic-looking, offering a delicate balance between the size of the stones and the length of the necklace. It comes in five lengths ranging from 15 to 20 inches, although <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">I'm partial to the 16-inch length</a>, as it sits nicely with my everyday jewelry (the 16-inch style I own costs $35). It's easy to clean, too: I use glass cleaner and a microfiber cloth to keep it extra sparkly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plenty of Amazon shoppers agree with me, too — more than 1,000 people left it a five-star rating. Many note that it looks "realistic," has "very secure stones," and is just "beautiful." One customer who purchased a "similar necklace" for "over $150" said the NYC Sterling necklace is "just as sturdy and 'icy' as the $150 chain" and a "total win."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Psychologically, something has happened to me when I wear the necklace. Not only do I feel more confident (even if I'm only asking for extra napkins at a restaurant), but I'm also more daring with it — if it breaks, I won't be heartbroken since it's a $35 investment, but so far it's proven itself to be tough as nails. If you're looking for a statement piece without the price tag, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">NYC Sterling's Cubic Zirconia Tennis Necklace</a> is definitely worth adding to your collection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yvxcJmqq2doqG2r7OMnKyboZNix6q%2BwqilopldqbKvusisZKedk6C5oq%2FE</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

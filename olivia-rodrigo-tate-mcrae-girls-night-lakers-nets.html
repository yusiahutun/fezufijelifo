In photos, Rodrigo and McRae are seen experiencing a series of emotions, from cheery and smiley to shocked and disappointed, as the West Coast NBA team ultimately took the L and the Nets won, 130–112.</p><img alt="los angeles, california january 19 olivia rodrigo r at and tate mcrae attend the basketball game between the los angeles lakers and brooklyn nets cryptocom arena on january 19, 2024 in los angeles, california note to user user expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the getty images license agreement photo by kevork djanseziangetty images" title="Celebrities At The Los Angeles Lakers Game" width=6704 height=5024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1938440679-65abe43946cd2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevork Djansezian</span></p><img alt="los angeles, california january 19 olivia rodrigo r at and tate mcrae attend the basketball game between the los angeles lakers and brooklyn nets cryptocom arena on january 19, 2024 in los angeles, california note to user user expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the getty images license agreement photo by kevork djanseziangetty images" title="Celebrities At The Los Angeles Lakers Game" width=5696 height=4352 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1938440911-65abe452ad240.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevork Djansezian</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the outing, the singers each brought their own flavor of courtside style. “Can’t Catch Me Now” songstress Rodrigo put her signature preppy fashion on display, layering an inky-black vest over a plain white tee, paired with a short black miniskirt, white ankle socks, and chunky black patent leather lace-up loafers. She added dainty, feminine accents in the form of small, jewel-adorned earrings, a bracelet composed of quartz beads, several silver rings, and a small black purse.

McRae accessorized her fit with chunky gold hoop earrings, chunky rings, and a small black leather purse.

I think she’s so talented and so beautiful. All those girls, I admire a lot,” McRae continued. “I would take qualities from every single one of them. I think that’s just what you do when you have really cool girls around you, to just be like, ‘Oh, my God, your fashion and the way you walk and the way you speak.’ We just take from each other and inspire each other.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d41b366c-0c5e-4fd4-85f9-ab612540d1c4_1701099318.png alt="Headshot of Christina Perrier" title="Headshot of Christina Perrier" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Christina Perrier is a NYC-based freelance writer who covers culture and lifestyle topics.

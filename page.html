We cannot start a week as dreary as this one already looks from my Monday perch (<a href=#>this</a> view, plus ten thousand loose toys and dark gray rain outside) with a complaint, it would not be good. But I have to tell you where I was most of last week because it’s so traumatizing, I cannot keep it on the inside any longer: I was touring kindergartens. Like, school, big old public schools with lots of kids. School for five year-old giants. School that my <a href=#>“baby”</a> will require next fall. It was terrifying. It was all-consuming. I tried to swim off my anxiety in the middle of each day, only to return home to find that the sun had basically set at 2:30 p.m. rending that whole cooking-and-natural-light-photography thing I love so much impossible. It was not my favorite week.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/11/sweet-potato-cake-with-toasted-marshmallow-frosting1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I hope you don’t mind me going briefly off-topic here. I know that the holiday week demands exclusive chatter about giblets and squash and all the things we can pour butter and cream into, but I had the best revelation this week and even though it’s about as revolutionary of a concept as, brr, it’s cold outside in November, I’m going to tell you about it anyway because that’s what I do here.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/11/parsley-leaf-potatoes1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> As you may have noticed, as the week’s progressed, things have gotten simpler. We started with great ambitions — we will make a <a href=#>green bean casserole</a> <i>from scratch!</i> We will trim the beans! make a roux! sauté the mushrooms! coat and deep-fry the onions! We moved onto my <a href=#>favorite stuffing</a> made from torn baguettes, diced apples and onions and celery, three herbs, sometimes cornbread, sometimes sausage; it’s a two-pan ordeal. We slipped quietly into the simple weeknight savior, <a href=#>cauliflower and brown butter breadcrumbs</a>. At the rate we’re going, I’ll have a boiled water recipe on the site by Monday. But somewhere between five-ingredient breadcrumbs and recipes that don’t need to be spelled out, there’s this, a potato recipe with only salt, butter and parsley.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/11/cauliflower-with-brown-butter-breadcrumbs1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> This site is 7 years, 4 months and 5 days old, which is exactly how long I’ve been meaning to tell you about one of my favorite ways to make cauliflower. You think I would have gotten around to it already, as it’s the very cauliflower dish I ever knew, but instead I’ve been distracting us with <a href=#>quiches</a>* and <a href=#>soups</a>, and <a href=#>pasta</a> and <a href=#>fritters</a>. It’s a shame, as this is so much easier to make.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/11/apple-herb-stuffing-for-all-seasons1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I have several stuffing-related confessions to unload today:<p>My first stuffing love was found at a friend’s house, when her mother served us an apple stuffing from a Pepperidge Farm mix that is no longer made, I presume because it’s not 1989. My god, did I nag my mother (who wasn’t terribly keen on packaged foods, <i>meanie</i>) to make it too. Sometimes she’d cave, though never often enough, but it didn’t stop me from growing up thinking that the <a href=#>dreamiest</a> stuffing includes tart apples, celery, lightly caramelized onions and herbs, a dream I was repeatedly denied as a child and yes, I’m requesting a very tiny violin.</p><p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/10/green-bean-casserole-with-crispy-onions1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> One of the best food books I read last year but rudely never got around to telling you about (in my defense, this time last year was a little <a href=#>nuts</a>) was a 135-page, photo-free and straightforward guide called <a href=#>Thanksgiving: How To Cook It Well</a> by the New York Times former restaurant critic and sometimes newsroom editor Sam Sifton. And although I realize there is barely a page on the internet or of printed matter near you right now not currently angling to be the one that gets to walk you through the biggest home cooking holiday of the year next week, I like this one more. Maybe it’s because one of the earliest lines in the book is “You can go your whole life and then wake up one morning and look in the refrigerator at this animal carcass the size of a toddler and think: <i>I have to cook that today</i>. There is no need to worry. Thanksgiving does not have to be a drag,” and continues in that empathetic but not remotely patronizing tone for the remainder of the book, cheering you on through turkey purchases and homemade stock, classic sides and newer ones worthy of consideration, game plans and even tidbits on seating, such as whether it’s okay to separately seat the Republican, Marxist and <a href=#>Free Spirit</a> factions of your extended family (in short: yes, <i>absolutely</i> yes).<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/10/cranberry-orange-breakfast-buns1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> When my husband had a bit of, uh, <i>bonus awesome free time</i> on his hands this summer, he got into the curious habit of running while not being chased*, which led to him taking part in his first 5K a few weeks ago. To celebrate, we had people over for a little New York brunch (that is, bagels and lox, no, not homemade, not when they’re <a href=#>this good</a>) back at our apartment, and, still trying to dig out from under our <a href=#>overzealous apple-picking</a>, I made apple cinnamon buns. I didn’t think they were a big deal; I mean, they were good, just your standard cinnamon bun with two apples, diced small, scattered over the filling but it turns out, you cannot causally mention homemade apple cinnamon buns on the internet without causing a RECIPE PLEASE ruckus. I should know this.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=426 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/10/perfect-uncluttered-chicken-stock1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I have spent a spectacular amount of time over the last seven years lying to you, pretending to care about soup when I, in fact, did not. I had good intentions, I mean, I get it: Soup is Healthy and Wholesome and Good For You and Warming and Comforting and all sorts of other Hallmark card-like sentiments that I’m not immune to the charms of, but the fact is, I wasn’t a soup person (so many spoonfuls exactly like the one before until I died of boredom may have been a description I’d have used, if I was being honest) and most of the soup recipes I <a href=#>shared here</a> stemmed from attempts at changing this, with varying degrees of success. Most were only temporary.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/10/spinach-and-egg-pizzettes1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> This, this mash-, roast-, horseradish-, bangers-, crisps-, and goose fat-free, is one of my favorite things I ate while I was in the <a href=#>UK</a>, and it’s not even British. Technically speaking, it was from a Venetian small plates restaurant, although I came to associate meals with generous helpings of gorgeously cooked spinach with the UK, as it appeared, to my delight, on so many plates. I had spinach tangled with a duck breast at a <a href=#>gastropub</a> in what felt like the middle of nowhere, spinach in small tufts on another <a href=#>pizza</a> (this one alongside a perfect pint) my first jet-lagged night in town, and a perfect amount of spinach at a <a href=#>pub</a> on a Sunday afternoon, kissed with the horseradish sauce that had been ladled, to my glee, over my roast, but this was my favorite.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/10/potato-and-broccolini-frittata1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I don’t mean to undersell this, but this is just a frittata. It’s not going to help <a href=#>decimate your weekend’s apple haul</a>, it’s not to going to solve the whole <a href=#>homemade-pizza-on-your-schedule crisis</a>, it’s not a cake you’ve been missing out on <a href=#>since 1983</a>, which was 30 years ago, ow. No, it doesn’t have higher powers or <a href=#>reinvent grilled cheese</a>, it’s not even the life-changing soup stock I’ve been meaning to tell you about for two years now (next week?) and I was about to say that it didn’t make the unconquerable in the kitchen conquerable, except that might not be true. This, in fact, did exactly that last Monday night, when someone told me about the recipe that morning and we had it on the table by dinnertime, no small feat some Mondays.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnx2f44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

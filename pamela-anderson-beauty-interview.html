Her&nbsp;house, while beautiful&nbsp;and modern—all wood and windows and shabby chic white punctuated by pink orchids—isn't&nbsp;grand. You don't have to take your shoes off; the&nbsp;closet wouldn't qualify as a studio apartment, even by NYC standards. She&nbsp;flips&nbsp;through the rack of clothing that's been pulled for the shoot and gives every piece the&nbsp;stamp of approval. By the end of the day, she'll have offhandedly&nbsp;shared revealing anecdotes about exes&nbsp;(like the time Kid Rock punched through the&nbsp;glass on photographs of Marilyn Monroe hanging&nbsp;next to her bed during a fight), called her mother on speaker&nbsp;to get family&nbsp;beauty secrets ("Drink lots of wine. Don't worry about things. Oh, I don't know,&nbsp;Auntie Vie smeared Crisco all over her face and then in the morning scraped it off and made a pie.") and served us&nbsp;champagne and&nbsp;tomato soup around the kitchen island.

But&nbsp;I don't think I would've worn red. But any time I've worn red, even red nails, it's lucky for me because&nbsp;it's something I really don't gravitate towards. It's so weird, I want to hide my nails right now, but I'm doing a film based&nbsp;in the '20s and I have to get used to red nails, so I thought I'd play around with it.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Aging happens when you're stressed and worried and jealous, or angry or bitter about your life."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Thirty years later and you're still appearing&nbsp;in Playboy with practically the exact same body.

My mom swears by Weight Watchers. You know, it's all food.&nbsp;Exercise is good for you, and&nbsp;it's good for stress relief and body&nbsp;shaping, but to lose weight, it's 80% food. It's just a matter of knowing a bagel is 10 points, so eat a piece of toast, which is&nbsp;1 point.&nbsp;I think it's food and eating healthy, and walking and&nbsp;getting out in fresh air. I think actually that&nbsp;when you go to a gym and start working out, you gain weight because you're hungrier.&nbsp;I do! If I do any kind of exercise, I eat twice as much, but exercise is good for everything else.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Is aging a scary word for you?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">No, aging isn't&nbsp;a scary thing for me&nbsp;because I&nbsp;look at my friends and they're&nbsp;beautiful, and&nbsp;my mom and my Auntie Vie—I was raised by really, fun exciting women. My family didn't have anything, but they always had a beautiful table set and they were always glamorous hosts. They didn't&nbsp;have anything but they still had the negligees,&nbsp;the eyeliner, the&nbsp;wigs. And you're just as old as you feel. I mean, when you're in a bad relationship at&nbsp;20, you look older than a forty year old.&nbsp;I think good&nbsp;relationships and having positive people around you, people&nbsp;that really embrace who you are as a person, is really uplifting and anti-aging, you know?&nbsp;Aging happens&nbsp;when you're stressed and worried&nbsp;and jealous, or angry or bitter about your life. A&nbsp;lot of people I know have had really hard beginnings of their lives, and have turned that around and look so much better now than they did twenty years ago—it's amazing, it really is.</p><img alt="Brown, Drinkware, Lipstick, Liquid, Beauty, Orange, Peach, Tints and shades, Cosmetics, Stationery, " title="Brown, Drinkware, Lipstick, Liquid, Beauty, Orange, Peach, Tints and shades, Cosmetics, Stationery, " width=3000 height=2250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/08/1456258754-hbz-pamela-anderson-05.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dan Flood</span></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I'm not into the grunge, I-don't-give-a-crap look.

I don't think those really expensive products do anything better than household products. My Auntie Vie&nbsp;was just splashing cold water on her face and using Crisco all over her face,&nbsp;you know, so I think it's simple and I'm not a big product person. Just be as natural as you can get, and then have&nbsp;fun with hair and makeup—be whatever your version of pretty is, as&nbsp;long as you feel confident. No one's to judge what's in fashion, but compassion is in fashion and it's sexy, so why not have this bombshell crazy look?&nbsp;There's this image that if you're vegan, you don't wear any makeup, you know, like flower child, and that's pretty, too, but some women want to be glamorous.&nbsp;I just don't like to follow trends.

A lot of people drew abs on themselves, I never did that.&nbsp;I never wore sunblock, I didn't really believe in it. I always felt that it was chemicals going into your skin and particles that go into the ocean. People always tell me, "You have to wear sunblock all over your face,"&nbsp;so I have a natural sunblock that I use sometimes, but I'm just gonna go with it and see what age does to me&nbsp;because I need to be in the sun.&nbsp;The first season, they didn't want me to wear makeup, they wanted me to be very natural. I said okay,&nbsp;but&nbsp;then I would&nbsp;go to Lexi's [makeup artist Alexis Vogel]&nbsp;at three&nbsp;in the morning and she would&nbsp;put eyelashes and liner on me and we just created that look, then I would show up, and they'd go, "You're already wearing makeup!"&nbsp;and I'd say, "No I'm not!"&nbsp;But then I'd&nbsp;get hit by a wave and my eyelashes would fall off and my makeup artist there&nbsp;would come up and go, "This is all that's left of Pamela, I hope you're happy—two little soaking wet eyelashes." But most of the time it would stay on; her makeup is nuclear. When I was on Barb&nbsp;Wire and had such a high-maintenance&nbsp;husband [Tommy Lee], I don't even think I slept for five&nbsp;months.

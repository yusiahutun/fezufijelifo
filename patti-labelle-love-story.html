Patti shared during Oprah's Master Class, as reported by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patti-labelle-husband-divorce_us_569910dde4b0ce4964242767 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Huffington Post" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Huffington Post</a>, that after she and Armstead fell in love, he proposed to her several times—but she turned him down. Then, she popped the question. “[He] asked me to marry him three times, and I said no," she revealed. "The fourth time, I asked him. He said, ‘Let me give it a few days.’ So he gave it a few days, and he said yes.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The couple married in Maryland in 1969, at the Justice of the Peace. Per Patti, the reception was small and casual, featuring beer and soft-shell crab. Four years later, Patti gave birth to their first son, Zuri, and the couple went on to adopt two more children: Stanley Stocker-Edwards and Dodd Stocker-Edwards. (Fun fact: Stanley <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/236945-michelle-obamas-cursing-stage data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="once dated Michelle Obama!" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">once dated Michelle Obama!</a>)</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0"><strong>Patti and Armstead divorced amicably in 2003.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">After more than three decades of marriage, Patti said that she and Armstead came to a jarring realization. “We realized that we couldn’t live together anymore. We liked each other from a distance,” Patti said on Oprah's Master Class. “When you feel that, somebody gotta go.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">She added that things stayed incredibly amicable even as the marriage was failing. "I never hated him. He never hated me, We just couldn’t live together—not because of physical fights or anything. We never fought, thank God, in 32 years. We got along even when we didn’t get along! But then we realized that we had to leave each other," she said. In 2000, the couple announced their separation, and the divorce was finalized in 2003—and their post-split relationship is pretty aspirational. “We’re cool now,” Patti has said. “He’s one of my best friends."</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">And the separation hasn't slowed her down at all.</h2><img alt="A Capitol Fourth 2014 Independence Day Concert Rehearsals" title="A Capitol Fourth 2014 Independence Day Concert Rehearsals" width=2100 height=1568 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/patti-labelle-1542811995.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Paul Morigi</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Reports emerged in 2016 that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3395857/She-hasn-t-happy-years-Godmother-Soul-Patti-LaBelle-71-finds-new-love-30-years-younger-drummer-Sweet-Potato-Pies-bring-sweet-success.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Patti had been quietly dating" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Patti had been quietly dating</a> her 41-year-old drummer, Eric Seats, for more than a year.

Recalling returning home after rehearsals, he said, ' there would be that terror waiting for me—that practical fear of bombing in front of the world.

He appeared to yawn as he posed in an opulent fur coat&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pascal refrained from speaking on Lux's behalf when asked how she had been holding up amid a turbulent time for transgender people. Lux came out as transgender in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But she is and has always been one of the most powerful people and personalities I’ve ever known. My protective side is lethal, but I need her more than she needs me,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pascal also described the struggles he endured early in his career, admitting he was 'getting my ass f***ing kicked' as he pursued acting.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite often getting passed up for roles he was close to landing, he received good feedback from casting directors which ultimately persuaded his representatives to continue working with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I guess that, and this delusional self-determination, and no real skill at anything else, is what kept me going,' he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Early in his career, he thought it would all be 'over' if he didn't achieve major success by the time he was 29.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I died so many deaths. My vision of it was that if I didn’t have some major exposure by the time I was twenty-nine years old, it was over, so I was constantly readjusting what it meant to commit my life to this profession, and giving up the idea of it looking like I thought it would when I was a kid.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There were so many good reasons to let that delusion go.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, Pascal is one of the biggest stars in Hollywood with starring roles in hit shows The Mandalorian and The Last Of Us.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Last Of Us, which is based on the video game of the same name, stayed close to the plot of the original in season one. In the second part of the game, The Last Of Us Part II, Joel, the character Pascal plays, is killed off.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking of his fate in season two, should the show continue to follow the video game, he said: 'It wouldn’t make sense to follow the first game so faithfully only to stray severely from the path. So, yeah, that’s my honest answer.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pascal also described how he's learning to redefine what being middle-age means to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I had a moment of thinking, You’re in your forties and you don’t own a home? Grow up. But I’m relinquishing expectations around what it is to be middle-aged and what it means to be fully grown up. Why am I trying to force a square shape into a triangle?'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He sighs and adds, 'I just don’t want to make any decisions.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-466179a85f26c7e9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/11/17/69712135-11961381-image-a-29_1681230643607.jpg height=634 width=634 alt="Heartbreak: Pedro's mother Veronica Pascal (pictured) tragically took her own life on February 4, 1999" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Heartbreak: Pedro's mother Veronica Pascal (pictured) tragically took her own life on February 4, 1999</p><img id=i-a63576a97dc6c393 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/11/17/69712131-11961381-image-a-30_1681230647508.jpg height=951 width=634 alt="'I need her more than she needs me': Pedro said of his sister Lux, pictured April 2022" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>'I need her more than she needs me': Pedro said of his sister Lux, pictured April 2022&nbsp;</p><img id=i-cd4b6272029af7d9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/04/11/17/69712127-11961381-image-a-31_1681230656493.jpg height=357 width=634 alt="'I was so scared that week that I was talking to her': Pascal spoke with his late mother as he prepared to host Saturday Night Live on the anniversary of her death" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>'I was so scared that week that I was talking to her': Pascal spoke with his late mother as he prepared to host Saturday Night Live on the anniversary of her death&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhqcWZmgHl9jomcnaqfYp2iv8Kao2askaG4tHnHqKqtoZ6cepSaq2aYp6aZq7Kzv8CrsGaln6m1pr7SZqeaq6Oeu6h50qKqrZ2iYpm2xI2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Ever since the dawn of the digital camera, left-hand poses with sparkling fourth fingers have become commonplace, but Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat have now granted instant access to the ring selfies of celebrities, friends, acquaintances and even complete strangers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For many, the choice of engagement ring is even more crucial now that images are carefully curated to show off size, style and sheer glitz, with many brides trying to out-do each other online. This ring-selfie trend is leading to an increase in "placeholder rings" – inexpensive cubic zirconia rings that are used for proposals before the bride chooses her own "proper" ring, to make sure the final choice is picture-perfect.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The added pressures of living up to social expectations mean many men are now terrified of making the wrong choice," says Guy Burton, the director of the London jeweller <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.hancocks-london.com/acatalog/hancocks_jewels.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Hancocks class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Hancocks</a>. "Around half of our customers would now rather choose a ring with their fiancée after she has said 'yes'," he explains. "Even in the decade that I have been working with our expert craftsmen, traditional proposals have decreased. Before, it was probably more like 80:20, in favour of the conventional route."</p><img alt="Jewellery, Fashion accessory, Pre-engagement ring, Engagement ring, Ring, Amber, Natural material, Metal, Macro photography, Diamond, " title="Jewellery, Fashion accessory, Pre-engagement ring, Engagement ring, Ring, Amber, Natural material, Metal, Macro photography, Diamond, " width=1369 height=657 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/49/1481031176-a14831-hancocks-rings-7520.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Diamond rings, from a selection, Hancocks</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Antiques experts like Burton are finding new ways to accommodate this shift, devising ways for their clients to propose without committing to a final ring design. "If a customer wants to have a physical ring to propose with, we can source the main diamond or gem and have it set in a cast solitaire ring which is inexpensive, and then they can design a proper ring together using the diamond, and return the cast," says Burton. "If the customer is completely risk-averse and doesn't even know even what type of gem to use, then we can have a design expertly illustrated by our in-house designer – if the sketch is not well-received then we can start afresh, with no harm done," he explains.</p><img alt="Blue, Text, Azure, Circle, Silver, Symbol, " title="Blue, Text, Azure, Circle, Silver, Symbol, " width=1531 height=1064 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/49/1481038783-unknown-9.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bespoke design sketch, Hancocks</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Diamond-simulant brands are also, naturally, reaping the rewards of the placeholder, as grooms are purchasing "dummy" engagement rings to use for their proposals. "Diamonfire has seen a steady increase in sales of engagement-style rings over the last five years," says William Hamilton, CEO of the Company of Master Jewellers, which distributes the cubic-zirconia brand <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.diamonfire.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Diamonfire class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Diamonfire</a> in the UK. Hamilton says that rings are being bought for proposals, but also as holiday and honeymoon rings, for those who don't want to risk taking a valuable diamond ring abroad, or pay higher insurance premiums. "It is perhaps also a symbol of equality in relationships," he adds. "In the past, a man claimed his bride with a ring that he chose, not her. Realistically, what woman wants to say 'Yes I will marry you, but sorry, I want to change the ring!'" he says. "Today, women want to be involved in the decision-making process of buying what they will wear as a symbol of their love, and the idea of having a beautiful but inexpensive proposal ring, as well as a forever ring that they adore, is doubly romantic."</p><img alt="Jewellery, Fashion accessory, Ring, Engagement ring, Amber, Pre-engagement ring, Metal, Gemstone, Diamond, Mineral, " title="Jewellery, Fashion accessory, Ring, Engagement ring, Amber, Pre-engagement ring, Metal, Gemstone, Diamond, Mineral, " width=580 height=386 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/49/1480955936-diamonfire.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Silver and white Diamonfire zirconia ring, £139, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.diamonfire.co.uk/product/baguette-band-ring/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Diamonfire class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Diamonfire</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Brands like Diamonfire use a variety of cubic zirconia and diamond-simulant materials that are cut and polished just like real diamonds. The metals used in costume jewellery also vary greatly in quality – Diamonfire uses silver that has been triple-plated with the precious metals rhodium, palladium and platinum, so that it never loses its finish.

With 250 points of sale in the UK alone, Thompson believes that Carat has a strong proposal clientele because its rings are virtually identical to fine-jewellery versions, and they use meticulously hand-cut stones. "Perhaps it's also due to the fact that there are many more options for engagement rings than there were for past generations," says Thompson.</p><img alt="Metal, Still life photography, Mineral, Gemstone, Silver, Pre-engagement ring, Engagement ring, Steel, Body jewelry, Ring, " title="Metal, Still life photography, Mineral, Gemstone, Silver, Pre-engagement ring, Engagement ring, Steel, Body jewelry, Ring, " width=454 height=302 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/49/1480956095-carat.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Emerald-cut diamond simulant and white gold ring, £280, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://caratlondon.com/jewellery/rings/all-rings/baguette-emerald-solitaire data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Carat class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Carat</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Amy Cochran, the buying assistant at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cirojewellery.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ciro class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ciro</a> (a cubic-zirconia jewellery brand founded a century ago), agrees that overwhelming options are contributing to an increase in men shying away from picking a permanent ring. "Most of the men who buy an imitation ring from us have no idea what to choose for their partner in terms of a real diamond design," she explains. Ciro also has customers who buy a cubic-zirconia ring that they would like to purchase in real diamonds one day, but their budgets don't currently stretch to it.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gemma Lathey, a teacher from Cambridge, felt that her placeholder ring was the solution to both financial restrictions and difficulties settling on a ring. "I am very indecisive but I was keen to have a ring that I would love, and I also wanted to contribute to the cost as it's something that I am always going to wear every day," she explains. Not wanting to rush into a choice, but keen to mark their engagement, Lathey and her fiancé bought a second-hand plain gold band ring with a small diamond to immediately celebrate their proposal, before later purchasing a more detailed 1930s diamond design for her engagement ring. "I do still wear my placeholder ring, my actual engagement ring had to be mended recently so I popped the first one straight back on, and I've considered putting it onto a gold chain too," she says.</p><img alt="Photograph, Jewellery, White, Fashion accessory, Amber, Diamond, Body jewelry, Crystal, Metal, Grey, " title="Photograph, Jewellery, White, Fashion accessory, Amber, Diamond, Body jewelry, Crystal, Metal, Grey, " width=349 height=232 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/49/1480956544-ciro.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rhodium-plated silver and cubic zirconia ring, £295, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.cirojewellery.com/collections/rings/products/cantassa-ring data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ciro class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ciro</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you're thinking of proposing with a placeholder ring, <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/bazaar-brides/news/a37967/the-other-cs-a-guide-to-finding-the-perfect-ring-for-you/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="similar rules apply to the real deal" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">similar rules apply to the real deal</a>. Try to estimate the correct sizing as accurately as possible. If this ring is temporary, it could be disappointing if it doesn't fit and therefore can't be shown off. Cochran suggests thinking ahead: "It's best to choose something of the equivalent carat size so that the bride won't be disappointed when she eventually purchases the real thing," she says. "This is something we always advise – if you have 10 carats in real diamonds then you can easily wear 10 carats in imitation!"</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">engagement rings</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsCzmJqqXZe%2FqrDErGannaeofKJ%2Fl3Fpbmegoa6ksceoo52domK%2FqrrGrGSwoKlixrDBjKagoKCkYrumscNmq7CnXZq7qK3GnqSepqRiv6q6xqxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

He probably had no idea he was gonna marry the girl he laid his eyes on for the first time back in 1992. However, the couple fell in love during their teen years and it remained that way ever since.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/06/jayhernandezdanielladeutscherpremiered95eg2vlnscl.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Jay Hernandez with his lovely wife Daniella Deutscher</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Zimbio</strong></p><p>The first love of the actor turned out to be the love of his life. Since Jay's wife was also into acting, the pair co-starred in the teen sitcom series Hang Time back in 1998. The fact that they had similar passion could be one of the key reasons for their amazing chemistry and the love that seemed to grow further with time.</p><p>Subsequently, the pair took their wedding vows in 2006 and they are living as an official husband and wife ever since. The love that began in their teens and still going strong in their 40s is certainly admirable. They don't share any children yet, although their fans are hoping to see cute kids alongside this beautiful pair.</p><p>There are no reports of any disputes between this delightfully married couple. Moreover, Jay has never been involved in an&nbsp;extra-marital affair. Daniella was, is, and will likely remain the one and only love of his life.</p><h2>Jay Hernandez's Early Life And Career</h2><p>Jay Hernandez's breakthrough acting role came in the small screen with the title Hang Time where he played the role of Antonio Lopez exquisitely.

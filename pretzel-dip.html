This duo is a match made in flavor heaven because it satisfies your salty and cheesy snack cravings. Plus, preparing the dip only takes only 20 minutes, and it can be served with store-bought pretzels. Ready to dive into the cheesy goodness of pretzel dip? Keep reading to learn about the key ingredient that makes cheese dip extra tasty and our recipe for this irresistible snack!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why cheese dip is perfect for pretzels</h2><p>Cheese dip and pretzels are one of the best food combos due to the flavor and texture contrast. Hard pretzels being salty and crunchy makes them ideal for dipping into gooey and sharp cheese dip. Also, you can mix extra ingredients into the dip that complement the savoriness of the pretzels.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The ingredient that makes cheese dip even tastier</h2><p>Homemade cheese dip is miles better than the store-bought kind, but adding a few dashes of hot sauce takes it up a notch. This pantry staple gives cheese dip a zesty kick without overpowering the cheesy flavor. Also, it adds a slightly orange color to the dip that makes it visually stand out from other snacks in your spread.</p><p>You can use your favorite hot sauce for the dip, but if you’re really into heat, then we love Traeger’s Carolina Hot Reaper & Garlic Sauce (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Traeger.com, $11.99</a>). This hot sauce is unlike any other as it’s infused with Carolina reaper peppers and garlic. That gives it a strong mix of fiery, vinegary and pungent flavors. You only need to incorporate a small amount of this sauce into cheese dip since a little truly goes a long way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Traeger-Carolina-Hot-Reaper-Garlic-Sauce.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make cheese dip for pretzels</h2><p>Our Spicy Lager Cheese Dip recipe is full of zing thanks to ingredients like sharp cheddar, hot sauce, lager beer and mustard powder.

Just follow these recommendations from First for Women Food Editor <a href=# rel=noopener>Charles Grayauskie</a> to reheat it so it tastes as delicious as when it was first made:</p><li><strong>To reheat dip in the microwave:</strong> This method is speedy, but Charles cautions to keep a close eye on the dip to prevent splatters. “Place the dip in a microwave-safe bowl and cover loosely with a microwave-safe lid,” he says. “Microwave in 15-second intervals for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring between intervals, until heated through.” (Click through for a <a href=# rel=noopener>simple microwave cleaning hack</a> that ensures the appliance is spotless before reheating your cheese dip.)</li><li><strong>To reheat dip on the stove:</strong> Warming up cheese dip on the stove allows the dip to heat more thoroughly. “In a small pot, heat the dip over a medium-low flame, stirring often for around 5 to 10 minutes or until heated through,” Charles says. “You can also add 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk or heavy cream to the dip to make stirring easier before it begins loosening up from the heat.”</li><p><strong>For more scrumptious snack ideas</strong>, read the stories below:</p><p><a href=#>Chickpea Fries Are the Perfect Crispy Snack That’s Packed With Protein — So Easy to Make in an Air Fryer</a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Game Day Snack Recipes That’ll Score Big With Your Crowd — Perfect for Tailgating!</a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Crab Fries Are The Spicy, Cheesy Twist On Regular Fries That You’ll Wonder How You Lived Without — Easy Air Fryer Recipe</a></p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.

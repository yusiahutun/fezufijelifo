As a prison chaplain, he has met his fair share of smugglers who want their family and friends to stop bringing drugs into Hong Kong and stay out of jail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since he convinced a Tanzanian drug mule to write a letter home warning people not to follow his footsteps four years ago, Wotherspoon, 70, has made the issue his top priority.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I would estimate the campaign has stopped one drug mule a week from coming to Hong Kong over the last three years,” he said. “Most of them carry at least 500 grammes, a lot of them have more than one kilo. That’s stopped 50 kilos of drugs from going on the streets of Hong Kong.”</p><a rel=nofollow class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/05/17/ef61910c-3ad4-11e7-8ee3-761f02c18070_972x_175542.PNG></span></a>Wotherspoon’s campaign has helped prisoners, too – more have written similar letters and received reduced sentences.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At that stage, nobody mentioned anything about ‘if you write a letter, the judge might give you a discount’. It wasn’t on their minds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Now, as soon as they’re arrested, I tell them about the campaign. Nobody has to join it, but I’d say a third do join it. Then I take [the letters] to court with my support letter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the last couple of years, most have been given discounts for their help in stopping drug mules from coming to Hong Kong.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The priest now posts all the letters he receives on his website, v2catholic.com. It is part of his bigger campaign to work with politicians and the media in countries whose drug mules often come to Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wotherspoon’s work has taken him to Kenya, Uganda and Zambia, among other nations, to spread the word on the dangers of bringing drugs into the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has since partnered with several lawyers to set up a non-governmental organisation, Voice for Prisoners, to expand on what he started. The group’s mission is to lobby for authorities to take more action in the fight against drugs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/05/17/7323b28e-3ab4-11e7-8ee3-761f02c18070_1320x770_175542.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some [drug lords] will come, they’re arrested at the airport, they give customs the name of the person they were supposed to meet. They’re now an informer, so nothing is done.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In return for protection, they sacrifice one or more victims a month. I’m trying to expose that, I think it’s wrong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re hoping that this new NGO will continue to lobby for more action on this front.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">People are dying.

He posts threats by them on his website and has since gone to the police, but that has not stopped him from continuing his campaign.</p>District councillor Paul Zimmerman has nominated Wotherspoon, 70, for the South China Morning Post’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Spirit of Hong Kong Awards</span></a> in the Community Contribution category.

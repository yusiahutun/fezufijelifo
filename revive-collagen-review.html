However, the inevitable side effects of aging—like the wrinkles, sagging skin, and hair loss—can make you wish you could remain 29 forever. Because our diets can make a huge difference in delaying the signs, I tried <a rel=nofollow href=#>Revive </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Collagen</a>—the most luxurious and celebrity-approved <a href=# id=auto-tag_beauty-3 data-tag=beauty-3>beauty</a> supplement on the market—for around 3 months to see what all the excitement is about. I also spoke to brand ambassador and celebrity hair stylist <a href=# id=auto-tag_chris-appleton data-tag=chris-appleton>Chris Appleton</a> to understand why <a href=# id=auto-tag_revive-collagen data-tag=revive-collagen>Revive Collagen</a> stands out against other anti-aging supplements.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/marykay_sc.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/skincare2.jpg><p>This product is a game-changer from the get-go (and I’m not just saying that). I’m notoriously forgetful when it comes to my daily supplements, which is why I love that it comes in single-use sachets that are tasty enough to drink without a chaser, making it easy to keep extras in my purse. It’s made entirely from marine collagen, which has superior bioavailability to bovine collagen. Because it’s in liquid form—rather than power or gummy—it also has an absorption rate of up to 95%. Not only does it <a href=#>provide a mega-dose of </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">collagen</a>—anywhere from 8500 MG to 10,000 MG—but it also covers all your daily vitamin needs, making it an all-in-one supplement. Chris Appleton tells StyleCaster: “They contain added ingredients like Retinol, Aloe Vera, and Hyaluronic Acid, as well as vitamins like Vitamin B6, B12, C, and D in the Enhanced Plus, which also helps to enhance results and provides those extra beauty and health benefits. Vitamin C also helps to boost collagen production further!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Revive_March21_24-copy.jpg><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=pros>Pros</h2></p><ul class=is-style-pros><li>Highly effective</li><li>Tastes good</li><li>Easy to drink</li><li>Contains all your daily vitamin needs</li></ul><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=cons>Cons</h2></p><ul class=is-style-cons><li>A bit pricey</li></ul><p>Now that I’m in my 30’s, aging is <a href=#>becoming </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a><a href=#> bigger concern of mine</a>. According to Appleton, we start “losing 1% of collagen each year after turning 25.” Gasp! As the years wear on, I’ve noticed a deepening of my crows feet, a darkening of the circles under my eyes, and some volume loss in my cheeks.</p><p>With so many powerful nutritional benefits in Revive Collagen, it makes sense why I started seeing a noticeable difference in my skin in just two weeks. After taking these supplements daily, I saw the wrinkles beneath my eyes were becoming less apparent. I saw that my face looked more lifted, as though the elasticity was improving. However, the biggest improvement I noticed—and the most exciting to see—was this intense and luminous glow my skin was radiating. It felt as though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I had a “pregnancy glow”</a> within just a few short weeks (and I’m definitely not pregnant). By the three-month mark, my skin looked downright incredible, making me stare at my face in the mirror longer than Narcissus. I’m also happy to report that I haven’t had a major blemish since I started taking these supplements.</p><p>I also noticed <a href=#>improvements in </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">my</a><a href=#> hair</a>, which started to look shinier, stronger, and healthier. I was never someone who received endless compliments on my hair, but I started turning heads and attracting comments like “Your hair is so pretty,” and “Wow, what are you doing to your hair?” after about a month of taking these sachets every day. After taking these supplements for three full months, I noticed some new hair growth sprouting at my hairline.</p><p>In the US, Revive Collagen is currently available in two formats:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original-28-Front.jpg><p>The original Revive Collagen product comes with 14 sachets (a 2-week supply). It contains “8,500 MG of Type 1 hydrolyzed marine collagen per serving, with added beauty ingredients and up to 100% of your daily vitamins,” according to the Revive Collagen website. A one-time purchase of this lemon-flavored supplement amounts to $49.99. However, you can lower the price to $47.50 by setting up a subscription and have your supplements delivered every 2 weeks. You can get even more bang for your buck by subscribing to a 28-day supply for $95, which will be delivered every 28 days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Enhanced-14-front.jpg><p>An even stronger dose of collagen can be found in sachets of Revive Collagen Enhanced Plus, which contain 10,000 MG of Type 1 hydrolyzed marine collagen per serving. If you want to see results even faster, I recommend the plus version. The tropical flavor is also my personal favorite! You can buy a one-time purchase of 14 sachets for 54.99, but you can reduce the cost to $52.24 by signing up for a subscription that arrives every two weeks. You can reduce the cost even further by signing up for a 28-day subscription for $104.50.</p><p>I was also curious to learn more about Chris Appleton’s experience with Revive Collagen, as the whole world is privy to the fact that his hair and skin is beautiful. I also took this opportunity to pick his brain for new trends and style tips. In an interview that took place over email, here’s what Appleton had to say:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023.JULY_.12_Chris_Appleton_RC_L.jpg><p><strong>SC:</strong> How soon did you start noticing results from Revive Collagen?<br><strong>CA:</strong> After the first 2 weeks, I felt like my energy levels had improved, and it was around 4-6 weeks that I really started to notice the benefits to my skin—my overall complexion looked healthier, and my skin was more glowey. Iʼve been getting compliments on my skin, and the only thing I changed was taking a Revive Collagen sachet daily.</p><p><strong>SC:</strong> How has using Revive Collagen changed or altered your beauty routine?<br><strong>CA:</strong> Iʼve become more religious with my beauty routine as itʼs made me realize how important consistency is for achieving and maintaining the best results. Itʼs so important to take a 360 approach to beauty and wellness too. Iʼm known for my work on the outside but what you put into your body is key for healthy hair and skin.</p><p><strong>SC:</strong> How is ingesting collagen different from using it topically? Does it have different benefits?<br><strong>CA:</strong> Yes, massively! Topical skincare products that contain collagen canʼt be absorbed through the skin dermis in its whole form so they cannot increase your natural collagen. Ingesting collagen through supplements is the most effective way to do this as they are broken down into smaller peptides which can then be absorbed and stimulate the fibroblasts in the body to help trigger collagen production.</p><p><strong>SC:</strong> What type of confidence has using Revive Collagen given you?<br><strong>CA:</strong> I used to suffer a lot with my skin, so itʼs given me more confidence, fewer breakouts, and better skin texture. Iʼm also really into my health and wellness, so taking Revive Collagen gives me the reassurance that Iʼm giving my body all the goodness it needs to enhance my skin, hair, and overall health from within. Iʼm also a big believer that if you feel great on the inside, you also look good on the outside.</p><p><strong>SC:</strong> Aside from improving your skin, what other surprise benefits from Revive Collagen have you noticed?<br><strong>CA:</strong> My hair has been so much stronger and shinier which is amazing as I like to switch up my hair color a lot. I also have more energy and a general glow to my overall health.</p><p><strong>SC:</strong> Do you have a game-changing style or grooming tip for men that youʼd like to share?<br><strong>CA:</strong> Adding root powder to your hairline is a great trick to add thickness and give a fuller look. It also works as a good face framer for all styles and can help give you a more youthful appearance.</p><p><strong>SC: </strong>Whatʼs a current style or beauty trend thatʼs giving you the ick?<br><strong>CA:</strong> To be honest, Iʼm here for change. I donʼt get the ick for style or beauty trends because I can appreciate it for what it is in the moment. Some things are not for everyone, but I think itʼs important that trends evolve and are accessible to everyone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Revive_Oct_22-copy.jpg><p>Although Revive Collagen is on the pricier end compared to some other collagen supplements on the market, it’s absolutely worth the investment if you care about your <a href=#>skin, hair,</a><a href=#>and overall health</a>. I mean, it actually works! With Revive Collagen, you probably don’t need to take other vitamins or supplements, as this product already contains most of the vitamins your body and mind needs in one day. It also contains a high dose of collagen, making it rapidly and noticeably effective. And because it’s formulated to give you the maximum bioavailability—thanks to the fact that it’s made from marine collagen and available in liquid form—you can trust that you’re benefitting from it as much as possible. I give Revive Collagen an enthusiastic 5 stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2BeHyTaW9sZ6Kaw6rCxGaaqKSclrSmuoyrnK%2Bhlax8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

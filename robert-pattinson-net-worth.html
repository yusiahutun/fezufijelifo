I was just living in LA and had been living in and out of hotels, and you have money for the first time.” He continued, “If you are the kind of person who needs to be pushed into doing something, then Hollywood is not the right place, so I think I might be done with Los Angeles. I’ve just realised that in the past few weeks.”</p><p>Despite his roles in Twilight, The Batman and other blockbuster movie franchises, Pattinson also told the newspaper about why he’s also starred in independent films like Map of the Stars and The Lighthouse, where his salary was much, much less. “It’s quite nice doing small parts.

He’s building all these little contraptions and things, just with Alfred. And even Alfred thinks he’s gone insane!”“ He continued, He’s been out every single night for two years, getting beaten up and shot and stabbed and burnt, and it shows. There’s a bullet graze on the cowl, right at the beginning. I don’t think that’s been done before.”</p><p>So what did Robert Pattinson make from The Batman?&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> reported in 2021 that Pattinson was paid $3 million for his role in The Batman, which is a lot less than other Batmans.

The magazine also reported that he was offered $50 million to return as Batman in 2017’s Justice League, which he also declined. <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> estimated in 2017 that Ben Affleck—who played Batman in four DC Extended Universe—made between $10 million to $20 million to play Batman as he came into the role with a base eight-figure salary.</p><p>As&nbsp;for other actors in the DC Extended Universe, Forbes reported in 2016 that <a href=# rel=noopener>Henry Cavill made $14 million</a> for his role as Clark Kent / Superman in 2013’s Man of Steel, while <a href=# rel=noopener>Gal Gadot made $300,000</a> for her role as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman in 2017’s Wonder Woman and $10 million for 2020’s Wonder Woman: 1984, according to Variety.

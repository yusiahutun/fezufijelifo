But did you know that just like your palate, your skin could benefit from a little salt here and there? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Salt beauty products</a> are rich in minerals and a natural exfoliant that can give your skin a thorough cleanse and tone your skin.</span></p><p><span>There’s a reason people find bath salts, a dip in the Dead Sea and Himalayan salt lamps so restoring. Salt works as a natural antiseptic and antimicrobial that draws out impurities from your pores, leaving you with clean, firm skin that can have a balanced and youthful feel. Bonus points: because of its dry, exfoliating properties, salt can also dry out acne to remove it faster.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DVFxtargetreview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question4_FI.jpg><p><span>“Magnesium-rich salt can improve the skin’s barrier function which will result in significantly greater skin hydration,” said </span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>Dr. Nava Greenfield of Schweiger Dermatology Group in NYC</span></a><span>. She referred to studies that suggest bathing in salt is beneficial for the skin.&nbsp;</span><span>“The same study goes on to show that sea salt may reduce inflammation in eczema. The salts improve hydration by binding water and have an effect on skin cell turnover,” Dr. Greenfield continued.</span></p><p><span>But keep in mind, just like how everyone’s tastes are different as to how much salt is needed in a meal, everyone’s skin is different when it comes to using salt in your routine. Even with it’s restorative and cleansing properties, salt is coarse. It can be too harsh for some complexions and dehydrating for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">those with drier skin</a>, so look for products made with moisturizing ingredients as well as salt.</span></p><p><span>There are two types of salt typically used in skincare routines: sea salt and Himalayan salt. A good choice for those of us with more sensitive skin, Himalayan salt is the gentler option. It is unrefined, hand-mined and has 84 naturally-occurring minerals and elements including chromium, zinc, iodine and sulfur.&nbsp;</span><span>Sea salt, on the other hand, contains traces of the essential minerals from the water it originated in. These minerals make sea salt a natural detoxifier, plus nutrient-dense.</span></p><p><span>If you’re ready to give salt a try, you don’t need to look any further than your own kitchen cabinet. You can find DIY solutions </span><span>toners</span><span>, </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>body scrubs</span></a><span> and </span><span>face masks</span><span> that only use household ingredients like water and apple cider vinegar, oil and honey. Dr. Greenfield suggests using a solution that is 5% salt. “Significantly more than that may not have the same effects.”</span></p><p><span>And you don’t have to go completely DIY to add some salt to your routine. Beauty brands already know the amazing benefits of salt and have been mixing it into both skincare and haircare products. That’s right – salt is good for your hair, too. A salt-based shampoo is great for a thorough scalp cleanse that prevents oily roots. And on the styling side, salt can add texture, hence beachy waves. (Disclosure: curly hair tends to be much drier than straight or thin hair, so curly girls, use caution. I sprayed a bit of </span><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Captain Blankenship’s Mermaid Sea Salt Hair Spray</a> because it’s also made with Aloe for a moisturizing effect. But I also balanced it with my daily leave-in conditioner. The result was extra volume, without the frizz!)</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Ready to start shopping?

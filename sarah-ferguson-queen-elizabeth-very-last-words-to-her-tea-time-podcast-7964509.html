So, in a new episode of her podcast,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tea Talks with the Duchess and Sarah</a>, Sarah Ferguson shared a detail about her final encounter with the queen, saying that the monarch insisted that Ferguson continue to be herself and live her life the way she wanted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ferguson went on to explain that she knew Elizabeth was annoyed when she'd act disingenuously and, apparently, could see right through the act.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's the last thing that the Queen said to me: 'Just be yourself, Sarah,'" Ferguson said. "And she saw it. She just got so annoyed when I wasn’t being myself. And that’s probably when I got into all the pickles. But now I am myself, and I’m just so lucky to be able to be myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not long after Elizabeth's death, Ferguson — who famously adopted the queen's corgis after her passing—&nbsp;opened up about how the dynamics in the royal family changed in the wake of her death. During a conversation on&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Good Morning America</a>, Fergie said she felt a bit of liberation without the pressure of pleasing the queen looming over her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't know whether it's the Queen passing that makes me think I can now openly say what I want to say without worrying I'm going to offend somebody," she said. "I'm really, truly authentic Sarah now."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Georges De Keerle/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's clear that Fergie and Elizabeth had a close relationship. Previously, the Duchess of York told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>&nbsp;that the queen was her "total idol." Elizabeth passed back in September 2022 after a historic 70 years on the throne.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She put you at ease straight away, because it's terrifying, you know? I used to sit there for hours thinking, 'Oh my gosh, this is somebody's lifetime to have an audience with the queen, and I'm sitting having a cup of tea,'" Ferguson said at the time. "She was so brilliant at putting you at ease. She had the most incredible faith of any single person I've ever met. She just knew what to do. She knew how to make people feel good. She never took it onboard as about her. It's about the monarchy, about making someone feel good. She was my total idol."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570pqpmqBdm7Kzs9SspqdloaqyprqMnqOispGXsrW0jK%2Bcq7Fdoa60wIywpquco2LBsHnHnqlmrJWWerW1zJ5kqaeUmK60wIxwcG9sZWWG</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The <a href=#>Sex and the City</a> star’s kids have grown up over the years, and photos of their transformation prove they look more and more like their famous mama.</p><p>Sarah shares her beautiful girls with her husband of more than two decades, <a href=#><strong>Matthew Broderick</strong></a>. The couple wed in 1997 and started their <a href=#>family</a> when they welcomed their first child, son <a href=#><strong>James Wilkie</strong></a>, in October 2002.</p><p>Throughout the next few years, Sarah and the Ferris Bueller’s Day Off star hoped to expand their family. However, the <a href=#>Emmy</a> winner struggled to get pregnant, and after exploring “a variety of ways of doing so,” the duo tried out their luck with surrogacy.</p><p>In April 2009, Sarah said she was “in disbelief” to announce they were expecting their baby girls. Opening up to <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> at the time, the <a href=#>Hocus Pocus</a> star said she was “so excited” to become a family of five.</p><p>“I’m really grateful. I feel really fortunate. My son is so excited, my husband is so excited,” Sarah gushed, explaining why they chose the route of a surrogate. “We’ve been trying to expand our family for a number of years. This was one of the things we discussed with seriousness that had real possibilities for us.”</p><p>Sarah said she was pure “giggles” when the doctor confirmed her surrogate was pregnant. “We didn’t expect it. I think after a certain amount of time, you tend to hold your hopes at bay a bit so as not to be disappointed,” she shared, pointing out the surprise of finding out they were having twins. “One really would have been thrilling and we would’ve felt incredibly lucky. And two was a comedy.”</p><p>One month after sharing the news of their pregnancy, reps for the acting pair revealed they welcomed their daughters in May 2009. “Marion Loretta Elwell Broderick weighed 5 pounds, 11 ounces, and Tabitha Hodge Broderick weighed 6 pounds. Both Hodge and Elwell are family names on Parker’s side,” read a statement to <a href=#>ABC News</a>. “The babies are doing beautifully and the entire family is over the moon.”</p><p dir=ltr>Since becoming a mom of three, Sarah has made it her mission to keep her children grounded. In an interview with Australia’s KIIS FM radio station in October 2019, she revealed her parenting secrets.</p><p dir=ltr>“Parents who aren’t well known can have children who aren’t grounded because of the example they set in their home,” Sarah said. “[I tell them,] ‘I will do my best to make sure you always have what you need, but I want you pining towards something. I want you to work for something, to dream of it, to will it to happen.”</p><p dir=ltr>In June 2023, Matthew revealed that his little ones were gearing up to attend high school in the fall.</p><p><span>“They said they want to go to separate high schools. They were very serious about that,” the Tony winner said of his twins during an appearance on Live With Kelly and Mark. “And then when it was time to decide for real, they were like, ‘No we’re going to the same high school.’ So they’re both extremely close but they definitely want their own space, their own friends, their own time.”</span></p><p><strong>To see how much Tabitha and Loretta have grown up since then, scroll through the gallery below to see photos of SJP’s twins through the years!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smKuZmGK3pr%2FSopqaZaCWv6yx0axkra%2BZo3qlrdSgn62doqh6sbTOraasZZ%2BrsrN506GcZrGVlr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

By keeping them caged, we are actually preventing their extinction. For example, some zoos have breeding programmes for rare animals which could -be targeted by poachers if they are left in the wild.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the mainland, there are parks for pandas and tigers. But only some of these animals are caged. The others are free to roam the park in a natural environment. They are also well looked after.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is a practical way to protect the world's most endangered animals. Cages can also help prevent accidental injuries caused by other animals and visitors. Since many people who visit a zoo do not know how to treat wildlife, they may hurt animals, especially small species like squirrels and birds. Cages are needed to keep them safe and also to protect humans from dangerous animals like lions, tigers and bears.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some people argue that animals may lose their natural instincts if they are kept in cages. But it wouldn't be a serious problem if they are well fed and kept in big cages.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Animals should be kept in cages for their own protection and that of humans as well. But it is unacceptable for people to take advantage of this to hurt animals, like keeping bears in cages to sell their bile for traditional medicine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jessica Leung, 16, Our Lady of the Rosary College</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zoos cage almost all their animals to prevent them from escaping. But I don't think animals should be treated that way - unless they are dangerous - because it is similar to putting people in prison for no reason at all.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When animals are forced to stay in a confined space, their mental health could be affected.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even ordinary people resort to this cruel method to control their animals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Harmless pets like cats and dogs are caged. It's the same with many farm animals. Pigs and chickens may have enough food to eat, but they suffer before they are killed for their meat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A caged life affects pets' health. They don't have enough space to move around. When they don't exercise, they put on weight, which might lead to illness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dog owners may say they bring their pet every morning to the park. But the problem is the animal spends most of its time in a confined space. After returning from the park, it will be locked up again.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some people say if the animals are not kept in cages, they may run away. When you have a pet, it is your responsibility to look after it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I am sure people won't want to keep their child locked up in a room.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Animals should not be kept in cages unless they are dangerous.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Freedom should not be a privilege of humans alone. Animals have the right to freedom, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdnZ4RzhY9oqqGnpaGxbq3NoqSapKNir6Z5yp6nrWWTlrSmvw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

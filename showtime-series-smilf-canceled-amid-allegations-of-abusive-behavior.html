Neither company gave a reason for its decision.</p><p></p><p>However,&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter<span><a href=#> published a story</a></span> in December that detailed allegations of abusive on-set behavior by Shaw, as well as violations of industry rules. Shaw denied the allegations, saying she worked to create a safe environment and she was hurt to read that there were cast and crew that were uncomfortable.</p><p>THR reported, in part:</p><p>… several insiders on&nbsp;SMILF&nbsp;who spoke to&nbsp;THR&nbsp;on the condition of anonymity say they are extremely fearful that Shaw will try to sabotage them professionally if they speak publicly about alleged issues on the show. They also express great disappointment at what they describe as manipulative and inequitable treatment — with behavior veering from warm to cold and threatening — coming from a rising female showrunner that has been outspoken in the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements.</p><p>“She uses this idea of being feminist and a progressive as camouflage,” says one staffer. Says another, “A lot of shows are generally unpleasant. Production is stressful. There are a lot of shows where people are angry at each other and then it’s over and then you celebrate the work. This was not like that. People were really traumatized. It was pretty upsetting.”</p><p>SMILF features Shaw as a single mom in Boston that is based on a short film she made that was shown at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. The show earned two Golden Globe nominations.</p><p>Shaw signed a two-year development deal with ABC Studios, which&nbsp;has been investigating reports of problems on set, according to Fox News.</p><p>“I can’t express how much I’ve loved making this show, how much I love the cast and crew and appreciate Showtime and ABC as creative partners,” Shaw said in a statement.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoZwfJJoaGlno528uMDIppxmq5Wntqa%2FjKykoqSWYrCiusKeo56cXZa6qrCMmqOlnZeWwaq7zaxkqJ5dlq%2B2v8ivnGaalZ2ut7XOq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

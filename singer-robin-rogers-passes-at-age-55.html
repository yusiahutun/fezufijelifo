She died at her home December 17 in Gastonia, North Carolina, where she was being cared for by her husband and musical partner, Tony.</p><p><br>In August the talented singer and harmonica player was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Like most musicians Robin and Tony were without health insurance and depended on touring for their income. For years Robin was always ready to donate her time and performances to a good cause, so it was not surprising that there was an immediate outpouring of love and support from the blues community and her many fans.</p><p><br>Benefits and fundraisers were held around the country to raise money for medical bills and living expenses. Rogers was deeply moved by the support, and was also buoyed by the success and critical acclaim for her new CD, Back In The Fire, which debuted at #3 on the Billboard Blues sales chart, where it remains in the top ten. Blind Pig owner Jerry Del Giudice said, "Robin always struck me as someone who felt she didn't have a moment to spare. She was constantly in motion. I became aware that her artistry and her integrity were two things she would not compromise and how genuinely she cared about others in need.</p><p><br>She was diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly before the release of Back In The Fire. She told me that although she didn't want to carry this burden, it was hers to carry and she would do the very best she could with every moment she had left. I read a Russian proverb sometime ago that goes something like this: When you are born you cry while everyone around you laughs. If you lead a good life, when you die you laugh while everyone around you cries. I'm sure she's having a well deserved laugh. As we cry we have to remember what a wonderful laugh that was and how sorely it will be missed." Rogers, winner of the 2009 "Best Female Artist" Blues Blast Award, was announced just this week as a nominee for a Blues Music Award for "Contemporary Blues Female Artist" by the Blues Foundation. And just last weekend Robin was featured on National Public Radio's "Weekend Edition Saturday," where she told host Scott Simon that despite battling cancer and the effects of chemotherapy, she felt "blessed."

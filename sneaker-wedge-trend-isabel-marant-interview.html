She had styled them with baggy dark-denim Bermuda shorts, a tight off-the-shoulder top wrapped around her collarbones like Saran Wrap, and layers of necklaces with chunky charms. The proportions were so perfect, it made my brain go analog: I forgot about the opportunity to take a sneaky photo and instead rushed home to sketch out the look in a notepad.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I couldn’t stop thinking about the shoe, so I ended up buying a pair. I wear them whenever I feel like my look needs something unexpected, mostly with shorts that would otherwise be too casual. The pillowy height makes me feel sexy in a cheeky way that isn’t too on the nose.<br></p><img alt="copenhagen, denmark august 09 a guest wears a green with embroidered white latte slogan cap, earrings, a white necklace, a silver and black necklace, a white latte with navy blue purple green orange checkered print pattern silk shirt, pale pink denim cargo pants, gold rings, a brown shiny leather nailed studded city handbag from balenciaga, beige suede and gray suede velcro wedge heels ankle sneakers from isabel marrant, outside lovechild 1979, during copenhagen fashion week springsummer 2023, on august 09, 2022 in copenhagen, denmark photo by edward berthelotgetty images" title="Street Style - Day 1 - Copenhagen Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2023" width=3563 height=5344 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1425192896-64878d08307e1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Edward Berthelot</span><p>A guest at Copenhagen Fashion Week last August wearing a pair of sneaker wedges outside of a show</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marant launched the original sneaker wedge, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.revolve.com/dp/IMAR-WZ108/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Bekett trainer" data-vars-ga-product-id=16119ab1-fb88-4833-959d-9ddca5fdbf11 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.revolve.com/dp/IMAR-WZ108/ data-product-url=https://www.revolve.com/dp/IMAR-WZ108/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100543834-12527506?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.revolve.com%2Fdp%2FIMAR-WZ108%2F&sid=har-xid-{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"9ceff3e8-65d1-4ad1-ab26-3b50ffc6f79b","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"16880","merchant_name":"REVOLVE","network_name":"CJ","network_id":"2","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100543834-12527506?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.revolve.com%2Fdp%2FIMAR-WZ108%2F&sid={subid}","network_name":"cj","appended_link":"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100543834-12527506?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.revolve.com%2Fdp%2FIMAR-WZ108%2F&sid={subid}-xid-{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-06-15 17:31:56.379019"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Isabel Marant" data-vars-ga-product-price=$701.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=192fab52-5279-4e23-8ba3-183fffe097f1 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Isabel Marant" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Fitness & Cross-Training" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><u>the Bekett trainer</u></a>, almost exactly 11 years ago.

So many editors wore them to Fashion Week in the 2010s that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://fashionista.com/2012/03/sneaky-trend-to-shop-now-sneaker-wedges data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="think pieces" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>think pieces</u></a> were published just to praise Marant for getting a heel-obsessed crowd to opt for something more comfortable. They were so popular, so beloved, so everywhere that you had to get on a six-month wait list to buy a pair—or score them marked up on eBay for over $1,000. And now, a decade later, they’re bubbling back up into the fashion zeitgeist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marant says she had the idea for the sneaker as a teen. “When I was younger, I was always wearing heels, but I was very tomboyish,” she says. “I always wanted to look taller, and I loved long legs. I used to hide some pieces of cork in my sneakers—to look taller and also to elongate my legs.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The shoes launched at a moment when business casual had become the du jour club look for young adults, and they offered a chic alternative to blister-inducing pointy heels. Wearing a pair made the essential formula of blazer, bandeau, and chunky statement necklace appear less expected, less square. And customers appreciated the opportunity to look taller without sacrificing comfort. Marant says, “I remember you couldn’t go outside without seeing it. It was like everybody had that shoe.”</p><img alt="new york, ny may 09 lindsay lohan sighting on may 9, 2012 in new york city photo by alo ceballosfilmmagic" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - May 9, 2012" width=3000 height=4329 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-144114152-64877e5d18cd6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Alo Ceballos</span><p>Lindsay Lohan in a pair of sneaker wedges in 2012</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was in college then, and I used to lull myself to sleep every night scrolling through Tumblr, where the shoes were everywhere. Earlier last year, I noticed them popping up on TikTok—2023’s preferred app for bedtime perusal. Clara Perlmutter—or <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.tiktok.com/@tinyjewishgirl?lang=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@tinyjewishgirl class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@tinyjewishgirl</a> on TikTok—has garnered almost 900,000 followers for her getting-ready videos; she’s known for playful looks that often involve crinkled gold metallic Isabel Marant sneaker wedges.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perlmutter has a long-standing relationship with the shoes. “My mom followed fashion and I saw the Isabel Marant ones over her shoulder on fashion blogs and I did NOT get them,” she tells me over email. Perlmutter decided to buy her own pair years later, wearing them exactly as Marant had intended them: “I am such a sneaker girl, but I’m short, and I bought them because I had the epiphany that I could wear them so my pants don’t drag on the ground. The Isabel Marant ones have such a massive tongue that my pants crinkle up above them in an attractive way. I normally wear them with low-rise wide-leg jeans or micro shorts. With micro shorts there’s a fab-leg lengthening effect.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You can tell from the comments on her page how old (or young) her followers are. Some claim the sight of the shoes unlocks long-lost memories, while others, likely born after 2003, just want to know what they’re called. “I was drawn to sneaker wedges mainly because of their practical purpose, but also because they are divisive—which makes for good content,” Perlmutter admits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Influencer and knitwear designer Lindsay Vrčkovnik, of the Instagram handle <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/linmick/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@linmick class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@linmick</a>, also owns a pair of Isabel Marant sneaker wedges she wears frequently. On a post about the shoes last June, followers wrote things like, “The sneaker wedge. I’m fighting the urge.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both Perlmutter and Vrčkovnik style the sneaker in ways that are distinctively not 2012—no skinny jeans here. In a video from 2021, Perlmutter wore them with a gold tank layered with a cutout crochet knit, zebra-print jeans, and a vintage navy Calvin Klein trench passed down from her grandma. Vrčkovnik often wears hers with miniskirts and shorts, frequently layered with multiple pieces in a multitude of bold colors and prints<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marant, too, has sensed that we’re reentering a sneaker wedge moment. In 2021 she released <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.isabelmarant.com/us/isabel-marant/sneakers_cod17143193da.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Balskee" data-vars-ga-product-id=f4c4ffe6-5f55-455b-84ca-3e040b996fe4 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.isabelmarant.com/us/isabel-marant/sneakers_cod17143193da.html data-product-url=https://www.isabelmarant.com/us/isabel-marant/sneakers_cod17143193da.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.isabelmarant.com%2Fus%2Fisabel-marant%2Fsneakers_cod17143193da.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=isabelmarant.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2b94248b-27d5-4836-8fcf-fd99cef9881e data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=isabelmarant.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">the Balskee</a>, a new version that is two inches taller than the original. “It’s really taking up new space in a different era and in a different way,” she says. “The world has evolved.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now that the fog of the 2010s has passed, those of us who get excited about getting dressed can see the shoe for what it really is: a freaky fun idea that feels right in line with what young people want. Sneaker wedges remind world-weary Gen Zers of a simpler era. They’re designed to be comfortable, which still matters to people used to wearing pandemic-era sneakers and slides. And they’re sexy, but not in an obvious way. Perlmutter sums it up: “They’re pretty universally fabulous if you’re daring enough.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.

Vergara got candid in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People’s Beautiful Issue</a> about why she doesn’t want any more kids, a year after the Modern Family alum and her ex-husband Joe Manganiello officially filed for divorce. In the May 1 cover story, the Colombian actress – who gave birth to her only son Monolo when she was just 19 – told the publication that she didn’t think it would be “fair to bring a kid to this world.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vergara, who previously shared that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>her and Manganiello’s differing opinions on having a family together</a> played a role in their split after seven years of marriage, was an open book when the interviewer broached the topic. When asked if she felt like standing her ground on her decision was “empowering and brave,” the Griselda star shared the relatable reason she wasn’t on the same page as the Magic Mike actor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was a mother already. I know what it means to be a good mother or to try to be the best mother that you can, and that takes a lot of sacrifices, takes a lot of energy,” she told the publication, alluding to her now 32-year-old son.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Vergara referenced the scientific advancements that allow women to have babies at an older age, she said the idea of having kids around menopause wasn’t appealing for her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Before, nature for some reason tells your body at 50 you are in menopause, it’s time for you to be done with that. There is a reason why nature is doing that,” she said, adding, “But that’s for me, and I totally respect where anyone wants to be a mom after 50.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Hot Pursuit actress also said she didn’t think her lifestyle was conducive to having more kids.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I didn’t think because of my career, the way I live my life, the way my marriage was, that it was fair to bring a kid to this world, and I’m not going to be able to give 100 percent,” she said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Vergara also shared how “rewarding” being a mom had been, saying, “It’s an experience that’s unique. It changes you, and it’s very rewarding and gives you a lot of headaches too.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 51-year-old star also revealed she sometimes wished she’d had her son when she was older, “more mature, more prepared to be a mother.” “But it is fun because I kind of grew up together with my son,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that Vergara is back on the market (and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>rumored to be dating Justin Saliman</a> after she hard-launched the doctor on Instagram), she also got real about the pitfalls of dating in the public eye, which, according to the actress, is “everything.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Because everything gets so exaggerated,” she explained. “Everything sometimes gets not interpreted the right way. So life is already hard. Having relationships is hard … But you just get used to it. It comes with being famous, so you can’t complain that much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qidopldq7Kzs8CrmGamn6l6uK3NraCnn12ivLOxjKSgnatdqMGiwMSmnKesXW2DdX2Vcmo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

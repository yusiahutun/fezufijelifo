The price tag includes a half-stake in a separate entity managing the asset.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The shopping centre was jointly launched by Swire Properties and the Sino-Ocean group in 2015, and became one of the most popular tourism destinations. Retail sales grew fivefold through 2021, the company said in the statement. The property is undergoing a “strategic upgrade” with respect to the mix of the luxury brands operators, it added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The acquisition will contribute immediate income and create long-term value for shareholders, the firm added. The transaction will be completed over three phases, with the first expected to take place after signing of the agreement and the final phase by April next year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/16/97075a42-3d83-4ddd-a4fb-bf0b3775553e_bb8cc9f4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The flagship Chengdu project represents a very important part of its growth strategy, underscoring its confidence and commitment to the mainland economy, said Tim Blackburn, CEO of Swire Properties. The group will invest HK$100 billion in its core market as part of its 10-year plan and has allocated HK$50 billion to expand in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Sino-Ocean, the transaction comes as a huge relief given its debt burden. Fitch Ratings last month kept its negative watch on the firm while affirming its junk rating. Sino-Ocean has 8 billion yuan of domestic capital-market debt coming due by the end of next year, the rating company estimated.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/12/07/CLEAN.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:27</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">China further eases pandemic restrictions in latest step towards reopening after zero-Covid</p><p>China further eases pandemic restrictions in latest step towards reopening after zero-Covid</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to mainland Chinese media reports in July, the state-backed developer was in discussions to sell its stake in the Chengdu shopping centre to China Life Insurance, its largest shareholder, in a sign of liquidity pressure amid a slump in the nation’s property market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some 39 defaulted developers are still in the midst of restructuring their debtload with creditors, involving almost US$117 billion of bonds, JPMorgan Chase estimated, including US$56.4 billion in 2022 alone. They included serial borrowers like Guangzhou R&F Properties, Zhenro Properties, Sunac, E-House and Shimao Property.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since mid-November, however, Beijing has issued several guidelines to rescue some of the nation’s developers by easing their liquidity crunch, including asking commercial banks to extend credit lines, providing bond-guarantees and lifting a six-year ban on equity financing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Sino-Ocean group, which will make a net gain of 1.39 billion yuan from the sale, said it intends to use the sale proceeds from Swire Properties to repay existing debt, according to its exchange filing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtflr%2B1tcKlnGhrYmWAdoOSaKqwoaKaerG%2Bzqmcq6yZmsBurtSyZJygmaOutHnTqKdmq5ikvbG1zaBknJ2eqb%2BmecKhnKeflKp6tr%2BWcm1mpZmhuaq7zWanmqqko7KzecCmoJ1lopq8sbHNoqWgZZSntrex</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

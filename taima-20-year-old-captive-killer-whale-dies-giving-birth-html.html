One of the theme park's killer whales has died in chidlbirth</p><p>Officials say a killer whale at SeaWorld Orlando has died from complications while giving birth.</p><p>The Orlando Sentinel reports that the whale, a 20-year-old orca named Taima, died on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Park officials say Taima's foetus was in an unusual position during the delivery. Park veterinarians attempted to assist but the complications were too severe.</p><p>The calf was stillborn.</p><p>Taima was born at the park in 1990 and had given birth successfully to three calves before.</p><p>She was one of two orcas pregnant at the park. Another, 32-year-old Katina is expected to give birth in October.<br></p><p>Both were impregnated by Tilikum, the whale who drowned a trainer in February.</p><p>Dawn Brancheau, 40, was dragged underwater to her death by the six-ton 'rogue' whale.</p><p>In November 2006, killer whale Katsatka dragged its handler Ken Peters underwater twice at SeaWorld Florida during a routine trick. The same killer whale had also grabbed Mr Peters by the foot during a 1999 show and dragged him in circles.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2004 at San Antonio's SeaWorld, another killer whale attacked its trainer repeatedly, leaving him in a serious condition.</p><p>'We are very saddened by this loss,' said Chris Dold, vice president of veterinary services for SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>'Although we understand that complications with pregnancy can occur here, just as they do in the wild, the loss of any animal affects all of us at SeaWorld.'</p><p>SeaWorld has had 26 successful births of killer whale calves in captivity, according to Dold, who said the birthing success rate is about 50 per cent in the wild and 85 per cent in a 'zoological situation'.<br></p><p>Killer whales, the largest species of the dolphin family, eat fish, marine mammals including sea lions, seals and walruses and are regarded as top of the food chain as they have no natural predators.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc4STcGptZ4SWtq6tjGtnZrGVlr9uu8udZJyZoKm2t7GMpKClpJWneri0wKWcZpyZmsBus8ivoKefXZe2s8DHZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

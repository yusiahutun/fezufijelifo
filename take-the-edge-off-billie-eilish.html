Find out how they unwind and decompress, while taking a closer look at the holy grail essentials they're currently raving about.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Singer, producer, and entrepreneur Billie Eilish has accomplished more in her 20 years than many people dream of doing in a lifetime. From earning 17 Grammy nominations and seven wins, to receiving her first Oscar, the star is well-known for her creativity and immense talent, which has most recently extended into the beauty realm.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In November 2021, Eilish debuted her first namesake fragrance, which features vanilla-forward notes with a soft blend of spices, cocoa, and musks that complement its amber base. "I wanted it to feel like a warm embrace," she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/a38015466/billie-eilish-fragrances-perfume-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="noted at the time" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">noted at the time</a>. "It's a scent that I've been chasing for years and years and years." With the success of Eilish Eau de Parfum, the singer is gearing up to release her second fragrance next month, aptly named Eilish No. 2, which is moodier and more mysterious.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A slight departure from her first fragrance in both appearance and scent—this version features an slate gray bust as opposed to Eilish Eau de Parfum's signature gold tone—and such, the upcoming launch serves as the next phase in the star's entrepreneurial journey. "I wanted to take Eilish the original and play with it, using original notes from that fragrance and make No. 2 feel like it's from the same family, just a little darker and more gray," Eilish tells us.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead of the official launch of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/makeup/a41444099/billie-eilish-no-2-fragrance-perfume/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eilish No. 2" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Eilish No. 2</a>, BAZAAR.com catches up with the star for a closer look at her inspiration behind the fragrance, the beauty and wellness staples she uses to stay grounded (including a ride-or-die philosophy when it comes to Olaplex), and her go-to method for spritzing on perfume before a show.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I understand that you were guided by synesthesia while developing No. 2. Can you briefly describe that process and some of what you saw and felt?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Things I was thinking about for this one were rain, water, and kind of a silver, metallic-y dark world. And I just wanted rain and water, and dripping and misty—anything that resembled something wet, essentially. And I had a lot of inspiration from dark, kind of abysmal-looking places, and that's what I saw in my head. I also really liked the idea of pine, woods, pepper, and things like that, which were my main Eilish No. 2 inspirations. I've always had an iron deficiency, and so when I was younger—and honestly still to this day—I really liked the taste of metal. It has this specific, almost sweet, but dark, cold taste, and I wanted Eilish No. 2 to feel a little like that in a weird way.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>If you had to describe Eilish No. 2 using only two words, what would they be?<br></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think sultry is a good one, also maybe mysterious? Or something along the lines of drawing you in—intriguing or something like that I think would be a good one.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Did your experience creating the first fragrance change the development or design process for the second?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was just nice to already know what I was getting into and know what was to come so I was prepared for all of the things, all of the little steps in the middle. I think that was mainly just helpful; it wasn't even like, "Oh, this is going to be different this time." I was just like, "I know what I'm doing now," you know? So I kind of went in knowing that, and when we got the samples of it, I made sure to wear the perfume in the right places at the right times and with the right mindset.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'd also have other people wear it and smell them to see how my brain reacted to the scent without knowing what it was at first, because I think that's really an important thing. When you put on a perfume—at least for me when I'm putting on a fragrance—I'm thinking about how the bottle and logo looks, and how I think the smell feels. But then that scent might smell completely different to someone who's just seeing me for the first time in a couple days who then hugs and smells me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's really important when creating a fragrance to smell it randomly on yourself, someone else, a piece of clothing—really wherever. I was in Zurich, I think, for one of my last shows in Europe, and I wasn't wearing Eilish No. 2, and I put on these arm warmers that I had worn on tour a couple weeks before, and it suddenly smelled like Eilish No. 2. and I was like, "Oh, my God, that smell! I know that smell!" I at first couldn't place it, and then realized it was Eilish No. 2, but the feeling of how it smelled at first without knowing what it was, I was very drawn to. So that was a good tell for me.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Billie Eilish Eilish Eau de Parfum</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$72 at Ulta Beauty for Eilish Eau de

emevuu60">Well, I'm a big Olaplex nut—I use No.3 before I shower, their shampoo, conditioner, No.6, the oil, No.0—lots of Olaplex. And then, I use a lot of Davines, specifically the Minu shampoo and their Naturaltech collection. Those are the hair things I've been using for years, and I love how they all smell. I mean, that's a big thing; hair products gotta smell good, you know what I'm saying? And then, I'll use a body scrub—honestly, I'll use anything, I love shower products. I also love using lots of body lotion, like the Laura Mercier Ambre Vanillé Soufflé Body Crème, and the other one I use is called Red Flower that has a palo santo smell that's so nice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My girl <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/ashlie_johnson/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ashlie Johnson" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ashlie Johnson</a> who does my nails a lot makes these candles, body scrubs, and a cuticle oil that all have this scent that she designed that I love, so I use her oil all the time—it just makes me feel good for the rest of the day. And then, I'll spritz on literally Eilish No. 2. I have so many sample bottles of it in my bag right now, and they're almost all empty; I've worn it everywhere so much.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Is there any place on your body in particular that you prefer to spray Eilish No. 2?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, I gotta do my wrists, all up my arms, but I overdo it, especially because I wear it a lot during shows and I go out into the crowd. And I want it to last, so I'm putting it on before shows, which are around an hour and 40 minutes so it has to last that long. And Eilish No. 2 does, which is really sick and a big priority for me. So I'll overdo it: I'll go all over my arms, I'm spraying my neck like a motherfucker, I'll go under my shirt and all over my chest, sometimes on my, like, sternum or whatever. And then, sometimes I'll spray my hair because it stays in your hair—I know you're really not supposed to do that, but I do it. Sometimes I'll spray the front or back of my shirt, my thighs—I don't know, I just go crazy on perfume, dude.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I love that.

And I started getting random hand sanitizers—because we all were getting random hand sanitizers—and I got one that I don't even remember what it was called. But it was this little tin spray bottle, and I kept it in my car, and I would use it every day after I was outside all day and touching things. It smelled so good, sort of like Christmas in a way, but also just like the woods and forest. And then I was like, "Hand sanitizer isn't the worst thing in the world like I thought it was." For hand soap, I really like Le Labo, and I have a bunch of different types at my house that I love and can't remember the names of, which is really great for right now.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Le Labo Jumbo Hinoki Hand Soap</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$46 at Nordstrom for Jumbo Hinoki Hand Soap" data-href=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/5316377 data-product-url=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/5316377 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5316377&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"e263d99a-3772-4907-9ae8-cde76366d01b","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689250","merchant_name":"NORDSTROM.com","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481570+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481594+00:00"},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5316377&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5316377&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-09-19 02:00:09.732653"},"8b6b0f67-bcde-4d9d-86c6-dedff1abae12":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5316377&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5316377&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-09-28 14:55:08.600504"}}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$46 at Nordstrom" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/5316377 data-vars-ga-product-brand="Le Labo" data-vars-ga-product-id=b159e2b9-ed06-4b85-b23e-ea0f6364a260 data-vars-ga-product-price=$46.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=f16f47bc-f226-4b60-a724-baf24734e908 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Le Labo" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=5316377_23825466 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Jumbo Hinoki Hand Soap" title="Jumbo Hinoki Hand Soap" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1666732439-le-labo-1666732421.png width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Le Labo Jumbo Hinoki Hand Soap</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: Nordstrom</span><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What's one piece of self-care advice that you'd recommend to our readers?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Listening to your gut is a big one—I know it's not a physical self-care thing, but it's a very important one. And also, it goes into physical things, like if your gut is telling you to do your face routine right now, then do it. For me, my self-care rituals make me feel so much better. I mean, even yesterday I was really tired and sleepy and felt gross, and I took a shower, did my whole hair and face routines, and I just felt happy after. And it just really made me feel really good. So I would say trust your gut and take care of your body, and it'll make you feel better.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related:</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tiffany Dodson is currently the associate beauty commerce editor at Harper’s Bazaar, where she specializes in trend forecasting, building relationships with major and emerging brands, and crafting shopping stories—from holiday gift guides to product road tests.

Here's what you need to know about the very aptly-titled Tampongate, which is featured in the fifth episode of The Crown Season 5.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What is Tampongate?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tampongate, which has also been dubbed Camillagate, refers to a private phone conversation between Charles and Camilla, which took place when they were still married to their respective spouses. The conversation, which happened in December 1989, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/11/the-crowns-controversial-tampongate-scene-vs-real-phone-call data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vanity Fair</a>, was secretly recorded and later leaked to the press. Due to the explicit nature of Charles and Camilla's discussion, the leaked recording caused an inordinate amount of drama for the royal family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Importantly, in 1989, King Charles, then still a prince, was married to Princess Diana, while Camilla was married to Andrew Parker Bowles. Not only did the recording suggest that Camilla and Charles had been engaged in an extramarital relationship for many years, its graphic content also raised some eyebrows.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As revealed in the actual transcript (shared by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/6226657/crown-charles-camilla-tampongate/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=TIME class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">TIME</a>), Charles told Camilla he wished he could live in her "trousers," so as to be close to her at all times. She retorted that the prince could be reincarnated as "a pair of knickers," to which he joked that, knowing his "luck," he'd end up as a tampon instead. Needless to say, the world was shocked to learn of Charles' late night phone chats with his former girlfriend.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Who leaked Charles and Camilla's intimate conversation?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Per the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-01-14-mn-1529-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Los Angeles Times</a>, Tampongate "was said to have been recorded by an amateur radio buff who picked it up on high-tech scanning equipment in December, 1989." At the time, Camilla was allegedly at home, while Charles was reportedly staying at a friend's country house, the publication reported.</p><img alt="a transcript of charles and camilla's private phone conversation is published in 1993" title="AUSTRALIA-ROYALS-PRINCE CHARLES-CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/picture-showing-the-front-page-of-the-weekly-magazine-new-news-photo-1668106724.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">RICK RYCROFT</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>A transcript of Charles and Camillaâ€™s private phone conversation is published in 1993.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A transcript of Charles and Camilla's conversation was initially published by an Australian magazine in January 1993, with British tabloids following suit later that month, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/01/17/London-papers-publish-Camillagate-love-tape/5636727246800/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=UPI class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">UPI</a>. Of his decision to publish details of the phone call, editor of British tabloid the Sunday Mirror, Colin Myler, said (via UPI), "Yes, I will be criticized. Yes, I will be damned ... But why should the people of Britain be treated with such hypocrisy and contempt?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was also alleged that the royal family might have been under surveillance by a British Intelligence agency, such as MI-5, per the Los Angeles Times. This claim arose as additional recordings of the royal family, including Princess Diana's "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a34751751/prince-charles-princess-diana-affairs/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Squidygate class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Squidygate</a>" conversation with James Gilbey, leaked around the same time. However, the surveillance claim has never been substantiated.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">How did Tampongate affect the royal family?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Understandably, Charles' leaked conversation with his rumored mistress sent shockwaves through the monarchy. In January 1993, the Los Angeles Times suggested that the leaked phone call "raised doubts in political and editorial circles ... that [Charles] will ever be king." While Charles has since <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a41587340/king-charles-iii-coronation-ceremony-date-time-watch/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="acceded the throne" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">acceded the throne</a>, the scandal has seemingly haunted him for decades.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Discussing the scandal, royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith told Vanity Fair, "It did him and her a lot of damage. His popularity plummeted and people were questioning his fitness to be king."

The contents of Tampongate hit the press in early 1993, soon after Charles and Diana announced their <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/separation-of-charles-and-diana-announced data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="separation in December 1992" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">separation in December 1992</a>; they would finalize their <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/charles-and-diana-divorce data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="divorce in August 1996" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">divorce in August 1996</a>. Meanwhile, Camilla and Andrew announced their intention to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/world/other-woman-in-royal-affair-plans-divorce.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="divorce in January 1995" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">divorce in January 1995</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What did Princess Diana think about Tampongate?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite having her own private conversation with a male friend leaked, Princess Diana apparently revelled in her ex's schadenfreude. In fact, in 1997, Diana's former personal protection officer, Ken Wharfe, wrote a very telling book called <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743XLLB9 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Guarding Diana: Protecting The Princess Around The World" data-vars-ga-product-id=da09f04f-4d2b-4b96-9e9b-3c03f58328f4 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743XLLB9 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743XLLB9 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0743XLLB9 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$5.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=9fdb7d0e-7b31-4c84-8042-101f757be771 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Guarding Diana: Protecting The Princess Around The World</a>. According to Wharfe (via <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/princess-diana-reaction-charles-camillagate-tapes-leak-tampon-bodyguard-ken-wharfe-book-memoirs-a7886311.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Independent" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Independent</a>), Diana reacted to the leak of Charles and Camilla's phone call by saying, "Game, set and match."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Any initial victory Diana might have allegedly felt upon having her husband's affair confirmed apparently dissipated quite quickly. "Later, however, she told me that she had been genuinely shocked by some of the baser comments, particular the Prince's tampon reference," Wharfe claimed in his book. "'It's just sick,' she said repeatedly."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Is The Crown's recreation of Tampongate accurate?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Viewers might be shocked to find out that The Crown's portrayal of Tampongate is actually very accurate. In fact, the script sticks pretty closely to the real transcript of Charles and Camilla's X-rated phone call.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Discussing the show's re-creation of one of the royal family's most embarrassing moments, biographer Sally Bedell Smith told Vanity Fair, "It did strike me as more than ironic that when so much of the series is made up ... that it would seek refuge in the factual when it suited their purposes and demean[ed the royal family]." She continued, "So here we do have an instance in a series that is largely fictional of them recreating the facts of what [Charles and Camilla] said because the [actual words] put them in a very bad light."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dominic West, who portrays Prince Charles in The Crown's fifth season, discussed the furore surrounding Tampongate, telling <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/the-crown-season-5-cover-story-charles-diana-divorce/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Weekly</a>, "I remember thinking it was something so sordid and deeply, deeply embarrassing [at the time]."</p><img alt="dominic west as prince charles in the crown season 5" title="dominic west as prince charles in the crown season 5" width=2006 height=1362 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/charles-crown-season-5-1668107173.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Keith Bernstein</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, with the gift of hindsight, West views the leaking of Charles' personal conversation very differently. "Looking back on it, and having to play it, what you're conscious of is that the blame was not with these two people, two lovers, who were having a private conversation," he explained. "What's really [clear now] is how invasive and disgusting was the press's attention to it, that they printed it out verbatim and you could call a number and listen to the actual tape. I think it made me extremely sympathetic towards the two of them and what they'd gone through."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for how closely The Crown's Tampongate episode aligns with fact, fans can peruse the full transcript, which was published by British tabloid the People on January 17, 1993, via the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/how-camillagate-tapes-exposed-secret-10958350 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Mirror class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Mirror</a>.

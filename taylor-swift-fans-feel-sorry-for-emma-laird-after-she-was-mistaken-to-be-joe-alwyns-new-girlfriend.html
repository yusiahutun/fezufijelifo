Fans know her <a href=#>long list of ex-lovers</a> doesn’t bother her, as she says herself. Instead, they become fuel for the ever-burning fire behind her breakup anthems and heartbreaking lyrics. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> and British actor dated for six years, after meeting in 2017. Fans speculated they crossed paths at the previous year’s Met Gala and were on the down-low for sometime. However, after they broke up last spring, Joe Alwyn’s co-star shared a series of photos of the actor, which led to a whirlwind of rumors Emma Laird was his new girlfriend. And then it kind of went nuts.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joe-alwyn-and-emma-laird-what-was-the-deal-with-that>Joe Alwyn and Emma Laird – what was the deal with that?</h2><p>When the then 32-year-old was in producing for his upcoming <a href=#>movie</a>, The Brutalist, his co-star shared a photo of him on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Joe Alwyn was featured in a carousel of pictures that described Emma Laird’s month in March – which is common thing for people to do on social media. However, because Joe and Taylor’s split was confirmed on April 8, with sources claiming it happened ‘a few weeks ago’ it caused the rumor mill to spin out of control.</p><p>At the time, people weren’t happy. They suspected Emma Laird was Joe Alwyn’s new girlfriend, which is a strong link to make with one photo. They weren’t even in the picture together, and several other crew members, friends and actors were in the photo dump too.</p><p>But some Taylor fans came to their defense, even if they were a fan of the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>.</p><p>One Reddit user said: “Omg they seem to be mad at him for existing??? And being in a photo? I feel for Taylor but with her fans she’s never going to be able to have the kind of relationship she seems to want.”</p><p>A second added: “Don’t feel bad for Taylor. She’s a “mastermind” and about to be a billionaire. She’s just fine and not even sweating over this guy. [Taylor’s] planning pap walks just to let everyone know she’s all good and so people won’t worry about her.”</p><p>And the <a href=#>music</a> star did just that. She was spotted enjoying herself with gal pals <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> and Blake Lively after the breakup.</p><p>That was before she found <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> of course. He put her on blast for not meeting him backstage after visiting one of her <a href=#>Eras Tour</a> concerts and the rest is history. Quite literally, actually. The <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> effect – because she’s ‘<a href=#>the best thing to have happened to the NFL</a>‘ – more people watched the Super Bowl since the 1960s.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trolls-took-aim-at-her-because-they-thought-she-was-joe-awlyn-s-new-girlfriend>Trolls took aim at her because they thought she was Joe Awlyn’s new girlfriend</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1179298993-953x1024.jpg><p>However, being a keyboard warrior behind a screen doesn’t help much.</p><p>At the time, anonymous comments were being left on Emma Laird’s Instagram photo because Joe Alwyn was featured. She had to turn the comments off to stop the online abuse.</p><p>One claimed: “We love you for ending Taylor and joe’s relationship.”</p><p>And someone else tweeted: “Now THIS is suspicious. Especially if it’s true that she’s liking things posted about Taylor & Joe’s breakup. 🤔 It seems like she wants attention. Well, now she finally got it.”</p><p>But other Swifties tried to jump to her defense to stop the rumor mill.</p><p>“Swifties attacking Emma Laird need to touch grass,”&nbsp;one person tweeted, “Like you’re seriously speculating that Joe [Alwyn] cheated on Taylor [Swift] with no actual evidence whatsoever and are sending her hate? Find a damn job or a hobby. Something.”</p><p>But it’s still going. Some people are still commenting snake emojis on Laird’s posts – one example being at Christmas – which is a symbol of the songwriter’s Reputation album. Others continue to do it on Kim Kardashian’s posts because she was tied to the <a href=#>Kanye West and Taylor Swift</a> saga.</p><p>Even though two months before she was seen <a href=# rel=nofollow>cozying it up with actor Matt Smith</a>. Although they’ve not confirmed the rumors. They were also seen packing on the PDA in July too, in London. So it’s clear, Emma Laird is not Joe Alwyn’s new girlfriend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-actor-breaks-silence>Actor ‘breaks silence’</h2><p>The star was busy after the breakup with the <a href=#>Grammy</a>-award-winner. After production wrapped he kept his head down. But he made his first public appearance back in November, at the GQ Men of the Year Awards. This was six months after their split was announced.</p><p>Then when <a href=#>Taylor Swift said she ‘felt lonely’</a> during their relationship at her Eras Concert, days later <a href=#>Joe broke his silence</a> with an Instagram post.</p><p>He hadn’t posted anything in several months, and chose to share a series of photos to show what he’s been up to.</p><p>Considering he was quiet on the photo app for sometime, the timing was suspicious.</p><p>But he turned the comments off, which was pretty smart.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2V%2FcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02admqajYrOmsctmqqiqoq56p7vRZpympZFiuaK10Z1kmp6kmr9uv8eeZLCZo2K6qr%2FTmqKepl2pvG6uxGahqJ1dlrm4xc2sZKedp2K0qr7Ln6minZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

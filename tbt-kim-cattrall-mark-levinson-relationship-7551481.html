Or in a relationship?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn’t want to waste time," he explained, to which Cattrall replied, "I don’t think he’d have come up to me if I were with a bunch of girlfriends.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kim Cattrall, Mark Levinson.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=28><p>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They chatted, presumably about their mutual love of jazz (more on that later), until about 7 a.m. the next morning. Five days after that fateful night, Cattrall moved in with Levinson, and they married nine months later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple’s meet-cute would later become an episode in the first season of SATC, in which Kim’s character Samantha meets a guy at a jazz bar and unexpectedly falls head over heels in love with him. “The dialogue from that scene was exactly what Mark said to me that night,” Cattrall added.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them: </strong>Unlike most celebrity couples, who prefer to keep the details of their sex life private, Kim and Mark were refreshingly candid about the topic. In fact, they even wrote a book about it called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Satisfaction: The Art Of The Female Orgasm.</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kim Cattrall, Mark Levinson.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Sylvain Gaboury/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In it, Kim wrote that she never had satisfying sex until she met Mark. “That is two entire long, awful decades of bad sex,” she said during an interview with The New York Times before repeating: “Two. Entire. Decades.'' Levinson added, ''There are millions of American women out there who do not have a satisfying sexual life. And we want to help them.''</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In another interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a>, Kim referred to sex as “the glue” that kept her marriage to Mark together. “I think sex should be really fun, and I think it's an empowering, positive thing for a woman to do. I've had that in a relationship, and I've not had it in a relationship,” she said. “And to have it is one of the gifts of life. Of being a woman. That component for me is really part of the glue that keeps my marriage together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> This video of Kim scatting poetry while Mark played the upright bass. The phrase, “You jay Safa Sou-RAY,” will forever be ingrained in our memory.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup: </strong>After six years of marriage, Cattrall and Levinson decided to separate in 2004.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Years after their divorce, Kim spoke about how her demanding schedule for SATC was partly to blame for the demise of her marriage to Levinson during an interview with the online outlet <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>news.com.au.</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It cost me my marriage because I was never home," she said, revealing that she consistently worked 19-hour days. "I was never there, and my husband got lonely and upset and competitive, and it was really difficult. It was really hard.” She continued, “You end up spending more time with my Sex and the City family than I did with my real family."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kim Cattrall, Mark Levinson.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=28><p>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now: </strong>&nbsp;Following her divorce from Levinson, Kim pulled a Samantha Jones and began dating a much younger man, Canadian chef Alan Wyse, who is 22 years her junior. They were together for five years before breaking up in 2009. Three years later, Kim moved on and has been with artist Clifford Ross since 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite SATC going off the air in 2004, Kim reprised her role as Samantha Jones two more times — first, in the movie Sex and the City in 2008 and again for its sequel in 2010. Since then, she has starred in other hit TV shows — including How I Met Your Father, Queer As Folk, and Filthy Rich. And this month, the actress will make a highly-anticipated cameo in the SATC reboot And Just Like That, which premieres on HBO Max on June 22.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since splitting from Cattrall, not much has been reported about Levinson's love life or his career. What is known, however, is that in 2007, he left the U.S. and moved to Switzerland and founded Daniel Hertz S.A., an audio equipment and software company.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705urZqOZonqkrdOtqZqknGK6or7KZqOerpmjwLC6jKucpZmknryvv8eip2ZvZWp%2BdYSQ</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

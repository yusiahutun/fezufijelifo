The pair met around 1976, when both parties were otherwise involved — Jagger with then-wife Bianca, and Hall with then-fiancé Bryan Ferry. Jagger invited Hall and Ferry, a fellow musician, over for dinner in London one night. "Bryan was flattered by Mick's attention, but he could also see that Mick was smitten with me. It couldn't have been nice for him,” Hall wrote in her 2010 coffee table book-cum-autobiography<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Jerry Hall: My Life in Pictures.</a> According to People, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Hall and Jagger’s relationship</a> overlapped a bit with the end of Jagger’s marriage in 1978.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After more than a decade together (and more than a few bumps along the way), Hall and Jagger <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>wed in Bali</a> in 1990.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-we-loved-them></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why We Loved Them</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The early days of Jagger and Hall’s relationship were emblematic of a very particular time, when “Sex, Drugs, and Rock n’ Roll” was a cliche used in earnest and Studio 54 was the only place to be on a Saturday night. While the relationship itself was reportedly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>riddled with infidelity</a> and grade-A drama, it will always stand as a marker of the era.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-they-peaked></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When They Peaked</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Well it’s not a peak, per se, but it bears mention that Jagger reportedly once told the Detroit Free Press that Hall was “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>impossible to live with</a>” after she stopped smoking. Ah, the endearing praise of a supportive partner. He allegedly told the publication he’d given Hall an ultimatum: “Either start smoking, or I’m leaving.” But Hall had an ultimatum for Jagger as well: "I told him I couldn't see him if he took drugs, saying, 'Go away and don't come back until you're straight.' He succeeded — he had amazing willpower,” she wrote decades later, describing how <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Jagger gave up heroin</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Express/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-breakup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Breakup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Which time? In 1982, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hall left Jagger</a> for a wealthy horse breeder named Robert Sangster. At the time, a British gossip columnist named Nigel Dempster told People Hall was “fed up because Mick refuses to marry,” adding, “There are times in the last five years when she has made relatively little money on her own because she has been traipsing behind a rock star, and she is worried about the future.” By the following year, Hall and Jagger were back together and expecting their first child together. “We just broke up for a while,” Jagger told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Rolling Stone</a> when pressed to discuss the split.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1992, Hall <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>reportedly briefly left Jagger</a> once more, this time due to infidelity on the singer’s part. As the story goes, the day after Hall gave birth to her and Jagger’s third child together, Georgia May, Jagger left to visit singer and model (and future First Lady of France) Carla Bruni in Thailand. “I felt sick when I realized <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Mick was still seeing Carla</a>,” Hall told reporters that summer. “I can confirm that we’re separated, and I suppose we will get a divorce. I’m in too much pain for this to go on any longer.” Bruni denied her involvement with Jagger, telling People, “He’s a fossil. His wife can keep him,” but that didn’t stop the rumor mill from churning.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Georges De Keerle/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1999, a scandal came between Hall and Jagger again — for the last time. Tabloids began reporting that model Luciana Morad was carrying Jagger’s child (spoiler: she was). <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hall filed for divorce</a>, but her and Jagger's Hindu ceremony was never actually legally binding, so she was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>granted an annulment</a> instead. "I didn't like the idea of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>annulling after 23 years</a> and four children," Hall later told The Guardian, "It seemed a bit rude."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Images Press/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the saga finally reached its close, Hall had some generous things to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>say about Jagger</a>. “He's the most fabulous ex-husband,” she told SF Gate. But there were some less than generous words as well: “He's a sick, addictive womanizer who made me very unhappy.” In her book, Hall wrote that she believed Jagger had traded his addiction to drugs with sex: “I had weaned him off drugs, but they had been replaced by sex.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-they-are-now></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where They Are Now</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jagger has been dating 35-year-old ballet dancer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Melanie Hamrick</a> since 2014.

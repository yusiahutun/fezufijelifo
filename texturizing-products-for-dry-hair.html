It doesn’t take a genius to figure out why: Texturizing products, from sprays and creams to even powders, impart a sort of sexy, touchable effect that emphasizes your hair’s natural wave or curl pattern, which is a look that you just can’t find out of a flat iron. But if you’ve ever used a salt spray (and of course you have!), then you know just how moisture-zapping they can be on dry, damaged hair. No one should have to sacrifice healthy hair in favor of sexy hair, or vice versa, so turn to these 6 perfect products instead.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/best-products-fine-hair.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jenna-dewan-2015.jpg><p><b><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/04/texturizing-sally-hershberger.jpg alt="Texturizing-Sally Hershberger" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Sally Hershberger Glam Waves Texture Spray</b> ($12.99, <a href=# rel=nofollow>sallyhershberger.com</a>)<br>Sally Hershberger is one of the greatest hairstylists of all time, so we’d like to think that she wouldn’t put her name on something without ensuring that it’s really, really great. We can certainly attest to the near-perfection of this body-boosting spray, which includes sea salt to encourage waves, texture, and tousled locks, and jojoba and meadowseed foam oils to nourish and hydrate even the driest of hair while also protecting from heat damage.</p><p><b><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/04/texturizing-bumble-and-bumble.jpg alt="Texturizing-Bumble and bumble" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Bumble and bumble Surf Infusion</b> ($29, <a href=# rel=nofollow>bumbleandbumble.com</a>)<br>Bumble’s classic Surf Spray was one of the very first products to offer that covetable “<a href=# id=auto-tag_beach-waves data-tag=beach-waves>beach waves</a>” look, but the high concentration of drying salts can leave parched locks looking less than pleased. They recreated their original formula and added tropical oils like coconut and mango, along with UV inhibitors (sunscreen for your hair!), to concoct a salt-in-oil blend that softens hair as it imparts lust-worthy texture.</p><p><b><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/04/texturizing-not-your-mothers.jpg alt="Texturizing-Not Your Mothers" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Not Your Mother’s Double Take Dry Finish Texture Spray</b> ($6.99, <a href=# rel=nofollow>ulta.com</a>)<br>Dry finishing sprays can be just that—<i>dry</i>—but this affordable offering takes it above and beyond by incorporating quinoa, keratin, silk, and aloe leaf juice to nourish and strengthen hair while giving hair grip and fullness that looks touchable and natural, not stiff or shellacked. We’ve found it works wonders on fine, straight hair that refuses to hold most styles, and it smells amazing, to boot.</p><p><b><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/04/texturizing-living-proof.jpg alt="Texturizing-Living Proof" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Living Proof Amp2 Instant Texture Volumizer</b> ($24, <a href=# rel=nofollow>livingproof.com</a>)<br>There are countless “volumizing” creams that contribute only to weighing down fine strands, but this flexible hold paste does no such thing. It’s ideal for layered hair that needs a bit of a boost, and our favorite thing about it is just how well it performs on dry hair post-styling. A little goes a long way, and it’ll give you major texture and <a href=# id=auto-tag_volume data-tag=volume>volume</a> that lasts for days with just a bit of scrunching in between.</p><p><b><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/04/texturizing-john-masters.jpg alt="Texturizing-John Masters" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>John Masters Organics Sea Mist Sea Salt Spray with Lavender</b> ($16.50, <a href=# rel=nofollow>johnmasters.com</a>)<br>This lovely mist is as natural as a DIY product, as it contains just three ingredients, but it has the efficacy and elegance of a high-end salon product. The pure sea salt is responsible for the tousled beachy look and feel, as well as enhancing your hair’s natural curl, and the certified-organic lavender oil nourishes and protects the hair’s shaft. Plus, you can also mist it onto your roots to absorb oil between shampooing.</p><p><b><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/04/texturizing-its-a-10.jpg alt="Texturizing-Its a 10" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>It’s a 10 Miracle Texture Fiber</b> ($20, <a href=# rel=nofollow>drugstore.com</a>)<br>Fair warning: The texture of this product isn’t like many you’ve ever tried before. It’s waxy and even a bit sticky on hands, which can be intimidating, but once you massage a tiny bit between your hands and work it into your roots, you’ll see that there’s absolutely nothing to fear. It tames frizz, gives natural, touchable hold, and can be restyled throughout the day using just your hands. It’s no sea salt spray, that’s for sure, but it provides major root volume that most styling products can’t achieve.</p><p>Read more from Daily Makeover: <a href=#><strong>The Most Flattering Texture for Your Hair Length</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWitdFmpZqhnKh8doKVbm5yZ6SaxbXB0aKxoqaXYr2zu8Oumq2rXZu8s3nDq7BmoJGev3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

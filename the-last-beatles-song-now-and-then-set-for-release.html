And now, 2023 brings one of the most anticipated releases of their long and endlessly eventful history. “Now And Then” is the last Beatles song – written and sung by <strong>John Lennon</strong>, developed and worked on by <strong>Paul McCartney, George Harrison</strong> and <strong>Ringo Starr,</strong> and now finally finished by McCartney and Starr over four decades later.</p><p>“Now And Then” will be released worldwide at 10 a.m. EDT on Thursday (November 2) by Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMe/Universal Music Canada. The double A-side single pairs the last Beatles song with the first: the band’s 1962 debut UK single, “Love Me Do,” a truly fitting full-circle counterpart to “Now And Then.” Both songs are mixed in stereo and Dolby Atmos, and the release features original cover art by renowned artist <strong>Ed Ruscha</strong>. The new music video for “Now And Then” will debut on Friday (November 3). More details, including global premiere plans, will be announced.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityaccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nowandthen.jpg alt width=601 height=601 sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A 12-minute “Now And Then – The Last Beatles Song” documentary film, written and directed by<strong> Oliver Murray,</strong> will premiere on Friday (November 1). The film’s global online premiere will be hosted on The Beatles’ YouTube channel at 3:30 pm EDT. This short film tells the story behind the last Beatles song, with exclusive footage and commentary from Paul, Ringo, George, <strong>Sean Ono Lennon</strong> and<strong> Peter Jackson</strong>.</p><p>On November 10, The Beatles’ 1962-1966 (<span>The Red Album</span>) and 1967-1970 (<span>The Blue Album</span>) collections will be released in 2023 Edition packages. Since their first incarnations appeared 50 years ago, these albums have introduced successive generations to The Beatles’ music. Both collections’ tracklists have been expanded, with all the songs mixed in true stereo and Dolby Atmos—new 4CD and 180-gram 6LP vinyl collections pair ‘Red’ and ‘Blue’ in slipcased sets. The UK single version of “Love Me Do” now kicks off 1962-1966 (2023 Edition), and “Now And Then” is featured in 1967-1970 (2023 Edition) to complete the career-spanning collections.</p><p>The story of “Now And Then” begins in the late 1970s, when John recorded a demo with vocals and piano at his home in New York’s Dakota Building. In 1994, his wife, Yoko Ono, gave the recording to Paul, George and Ringo, along with John’s demos for “Free As A Bird” and “Real Love,” which were both completed as new Beatles songs and respectively released as singles in 1995 and 1996, as part of The Beatles Anthology project. At the same time, Paul, George and Ringo recorded new parts and completed a rough mix for “Now And Then” with producer <strong>Jeff Lynne.</strong> At that point, technological limitations prevented John’s vocals and piano from being separated to achieve the precise, unclouded mix needed to finish the song. “Now And Then” was shelved, with a hope that one day it would be revisited.</p><p>Cut to 2021, and the release of The Beatles: Get Back docuseries, directed by <strong>Peter Jackson,</strong> which astonished viewers with its award-winning film and audio restoration. Using WingNut Films’ MAL audio technology, Jackson’s team de-mixed the film’s mono soundtrack, isolating instruments, vocals, and all the individual voices within The Beatle’s conversations. This achievement opened the way to 2022’s new mix of Revolver, sourced directly from the four-track master tapes. This led to a question: what could now be done with the “Now And Then” demo? Jackson and his sound team, led by <strong>Emile de la Rey,</strong> applied the same technique to John’s original home recording, preserving the clarity and integrity of his original vocal performance by separating it from the piano.</p><p>In 2022, Paul and Ringo set about completing the song. Besides John’s vocal, “Now And Then” includes electric and acoustic guitar recorded in 1995 by George, Ringo’s new drum part, and bass, guitar and piano from Paul, which matches John’s original playing. Paul added a slide guitar solo inspired by George; he and Ringo also contributed backing vocals to the chorus.</p><p>Paul oversaw a Capitol Studios recording session in Los Angeles for the song’s dreamy, quintessentially Beatles string arrangement, written by <strong>Giles Martin</strong>, Paul and Ben Foster. Paul and Giles also added one last, wonderfully subtle touch: backing vocals from the original recordings of “Here, There And Everywhere,” “Eleanor Rigby,” and “Because,” woven into the new song using the techniques perfected during the making of the LOVE show and album. The finished track was produced by Paul and Giles and mixed by<strong> Spike Stent.</strong></p><p>Paul says: “There it was, John’s voice, crystal clear. It’s quite emotional. And we all play on it; it’s a genuine Beatles recording. In 2023, to still be working on Beatles music and about to release a new song the public haven’t heard, I think it’s an exciting thing.”</p><p>Ringo says: “It was the closest we’ll ever come to having him back in the room, so it was very emotional for all of us. It was like John was there, you know. It’s far out.”</p><p>Sean Ono Lennon says: “It was incredibly touching to hear them working together after all the years that Dad had been gone. It’s the last song my dad, Paul, George and Ringo got to make together. It’s like a time capsule, and all feels very meant to be.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfY9oaXBnpJ2ybrjArKtmmpWWwa2x0maqqKaXYruww4yapZ1lpJ2yr3nSnqtmnp%2BnerOxy56YrJ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The small critters were able to access a wider variety of food supplies, and quickly evolve in size and tooth shape, a key aspect in determining what prey is available. This speedy evolution is apparent in the three new species discovered. They are all predecessors of ungulates, hoofed mammals like horses and cows, and grew to the size of a modern-day cat.&nbsp;This might not seem particularly impressive, but given that most mammals in the time of dinosaurs were roughly mouse-sized, it's a big leap in a relatively short time.</p><p>The biggest of the three was named after Beorn, a character in "The Hobbit" that can take the form of man or bear. The newly-discovered mammal, Beornus honeyi, had large inflated molars that gave it a bear-like appearance, unique from the other mammals of its time. The other species discovered also differ from their contemporaries by unique tooth shape. This suggests that the diversity of mammals in this period was way greater than previously thought, a testament to the accelerated speed that these creatures developed in a world free from the giant reptiles that had ruled for millions of years. It was an opportunity for a boom in mammalian evolution that was vital for the arrival of humans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCj2pqcmlfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZquhnV2jsrh5x6iZm6GkYrCzscCtrKudXam1osCMsJisZZSewKS71Z6pnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

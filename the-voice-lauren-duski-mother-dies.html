She was found in her car on the side of the road, slumped over. She'd suffered a single gunshot wound to the chest — the gun was found nearby.</p><p>On Instagram, Duski wrote a lengthy tribute to her mother that features a reminder to check in on loved ones frequently, especially if they're going through trouble.</p><p>"If you’re struggling, do not be ashamed. Do not be ashamed. Do not be ashamed," she writes. "Your mental health is nothing to be ashamed of and neither is talking about it. We are all trying to navigate this beautiful, messy life."</p>"I’ve learned that even the strongest humans have a breaking point. Be patient and gentle with yourself. Minute by minute. Please do not lose hope. Trust in God. There is always another chance…and there will never be another you."<p>Duski calls her mother "the greatest human I've ever known" and recounts her generosity. "She set the bar above the moon. She adored her family and her grandchildren. She was an endless dreamer. Brilliant. An absolute powerhouse," she notes.</p><p>Janis Duski served in the U.S. Air Force and worked hard to bring proper oral healthcare to disabled and homeless military veterans in Michigan.

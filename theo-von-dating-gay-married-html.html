Similarly, a TV program host, podcaster, and aspiring entrepreneur is a modest person at heart who attributes his success to his family, particularly his devoted father. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Taking that into account, it's reasonable to say that no guy is as perfect and lovable as the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">No Offense</a> star. Brandi Glanville, the love of his life, would agree with us on this one.</p><p style=text-align:justify>With all of the stories that have surfaced about him, the question remains: are they still dating? Have they chosen to marry, or have they decided to split ways? What about the claims that he is gay? We'll look at who&nbsp;Von is dating right now, as well as who he's dated in the past.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Dating Anyone or Got Hitched? Any Credence To The Gossips?</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Any speculation about the comedian's dating past is subject to change, and keeping track of all of his flings and breakups has proven to be quite tough. However, the 41-year-old was in a relationship with Brandi Glanville, a former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, extremely public. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Glanville confirmed they were dating in April 2016 in an interview with The Daily Dish. When she talked about the humor star, the thrill in her voice&nbsp;was apparent, even if she didn't officially call him her boyfriend. We're captivated, to say the least. It's no surprise that she was smitten with the Last Comic Standing competitor, who is both funny and nice.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Theo Von and reality star Brandi Glanville first got romantically linked in April 2016</strong> (Photo:- liverampup.com)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>The finest trait that captivated her was his ability to make his beloved laugh. She just liked being with him, demonstrating how genuine their chemistry was.</p><p>However, what was meant to be a joyous tale ended up being a sad one. As they worked in their own fields, the relationship between them grew even stronger. Sadly, their budding romance took a sharp turn for the worst due to their busy schedules, and the pair called it off barely a month after dating. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>More Story On Brandi:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Donald Friese Splits with Brandi Glanville, 45!

Following his major break-up, we see less of his dating information made public, which is logical given his desire to remain low-key.&nbsp;Yet, one of his tweets sent followers into a frenzy as they tried to figure out who he was talking to.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Theo Von cheekily mentions girlfriend in a tweet dated back to 2015</strong> (Photo:- Theo Von's Twitter)</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>However, he made it obvious that when it came to dating, he had several priorities. Football, of course, is his preferred mate! In a Tweet on September 8, 2017, he admits to being gay for football.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Find Out More About Theo Von: What Made Him Pursue Comedy?</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Theodor</a> Capitani von Kurnatowski, commonly known as Theo Von, was born to Gina Capitani and Roland von Kurnatowski Sr. on March 19, 1980. As previously said, the comedic star attributes his success to his father, believing that this strange family fact shaped him into the person he is now. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Explore:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Will War Machine Ever Get Married Given These Terrible Dating Record?" rel=follow>Will War Machine Ever Get Married Given These Terrible Dating Record?</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>He boasts about the startling fact that he and his father share a 70-year age gap, which he considers to be a unique success story. And, in Von's opinion, that fact alone qualifies him as a stand-up comedian. During one of his performances, he stated:</p><p style=text-align:justify>"My father was 70 years old when I was born, OK? True story; I'm not joking. My dad was born in 1910, I was born in 1980, which basically makes me a stand-up comedian."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>He is as eclectic as his ancestry, having Italian, German, English, Sottish, and Polish ancestors.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>His commercial success is based on what he does best, humor and a net worth of well over $500,000.

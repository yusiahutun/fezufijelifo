And thankfully, very few of its competitors have followed along. Most major streaming services still allow you to share your account, though they may limit the number of users who can stream video simultaneously.</p><p>Here are the on-demand streaming services that still allow account sharing:</p><ul><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Amazon Prime Video</a></strong></li><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow"><strong>Apple TV+</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Disney+</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">ESPN+</a></strong></li><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow"><strong>Hulu</strong></a></li><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow"><strong>Max</strong></a> (Formerly HBO Max)</li><li><a href=#><strong>Mubi</strong></a></li><li><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow"><strong>Paramount+</strong></a></li><li><a href=#><strong>Peacock</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href=#>SHUDDER</a></strong></li></ul><p>Note that these services could change their policies at any time. Also, while you can share a standard Hulu account, Hulu with Live TV subscribers are treated a bit differently.

But these preventative measures are often just an annoyance. And some live TV platforms don't seem to care about account sharing at all.</p><p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Sling TV</a> is the most moocher-friendly live TV service. If you get a Sling TV Blue membership, your account can stream on three devices simultaneously, regardless of their location.

Still, this policy seems to be pretty effective. A report from&nbsp;<a href=#>Antenna</a> shows that Netflix daily signups increased exponentially in May of 2023, the month that Netflix's password-sharing crackdown began in the United States.</p><p>In fact, Netflix's aggressive new policy led to more daily signups than the March 2020 COVID lockdowns. If Netflix continues to garner new subscriptions, other streaming services may come to the conclusion that account sharing is bad for business.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>More Than Half of Netflix's Library Is Original Content, for Better or Worse</a></span></p><p>We may see other platforms follow in Netflix's footsteps. Even services like Prime Video, which recently mocked Netflix's new policy, could decide to crack down on moochers. After all, most streaming services <a href=#>are unprofitable</a>.</p><p>On the bright side, Netflix is a fully-matured streaming service with a <a href=#>massive collection</a> of original content.

Instead of subscribing to a half-dozen services, you can simply ask friends and family to share their accounts. (And if you're a nice person, you'll subscribe to at least one service so you can share it with others.)</p><p>But things are changing, and account sharing may not be a realistic option in the future. You'll need to save money the old-fashioned way---by cutting back. Thankfully, this isn't too difficult.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Free Streaming Services Might Be Better Than Netflix</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, you need to start rotating your subscriptions. There's no reason to have a Netflix account if you only use it to watch the two "must-see Originals" that come out every year. Start making lists of the shows and movies you want to watch, including content that hasn't been released yet. Then, at the end of each month, cancel one service and switch to another.</p><p>Rotating your subscription requires a bit of self-control, but it's a huge money saver (especially if you're offered free trials). But you can also save money by using <a href=#>free streaming services</a> like Pluto TV, The Roku Channel, and Tubi. They're better than you think!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhobnBjbIJwwMeeqp5lo6m%2Fpq3MoqWgZaOav7e1wp6qZq%2Bfo8FuvNSnoKygXa68tnnFqKlmqJGowLi70Z1krKCRp7avs44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

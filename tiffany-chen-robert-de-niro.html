The couple split in 1988 and from then De Niro was in a relationship with <a href=# rel=noopener>model</a> Toukie Smith until 1996. They share twin sons, Julian and Aaron, who arrived in 1995.</p><p>In 1997, De Niro married actor Grace Hightower and they welcomed their son Elliot a year later. While the couple announced a split in 1999, their divorce was never finalized and in 2004, they renewed their vows. They welcomed a daughter in 2011 but in 2018, Hightower and De Niro announced their official separation. In 2021, De Niro was rumored to be in a relationship with <a href=# id=auto-tag_tiffany-chen data-tag=tiffany-chen>Tiffany Chen</a> and in May 2023, he announced he’d welcomed another child but stayed mum (pardon the pun) on who the mother was. Here’s everything we know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-tiffany-chen>Who is Tiffany Chen?</h2><p>Tiffany Chen is <a href=# id=auto-tag_robert-de-niro data-tag=robert-de-niro>Robert De Niro</a>’s rumored girlfriend since they were first spotted together in 2021. FYI she’s not to be confused with another entertainment industry-present Tiffany Chen who, at the time of writing in 2023 is 64.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1488698224.jpg><p>At the premiere of the comedy film About My Father on May 9, 2023, De Niro’s co-star Kim Cattrall maybe have confirmed their relationship when asked about how she felt about his newborn baby. “God bless him. His significant other, Tiffany, is such a beautiful woman,” Cattrall told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Extra!</a> She came to the set once with their family to watch filming and she was gorgeous and sweet. I’m happy for both of them.”</p><p>According to an anonymous source quoted by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> on May 10, 2023, the actor and Chen live together in Los Angeles, where De Niro “maintains a busy work schedule.” The insider revealed: “He wrapped Wise Guys earlier this year. He was very focused and energetic during filming. Just so professional and skillful. Truly a master at acting.” They added that “Tiffany seemed supportive” and “visited the set” where her partner was working: “He seemed excited to have her around.”</p><p>On Thursday, De Niro shared with Gayle King on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CBS Mornings</a> that he welcomed Gia Virginia Chen De Niro with his girlfriend Tiffany Chen on Thursday, April 6. The baby girl was born weighing 8 lbs., 6 oz. Speaking of About My Father, King asked De Niro if any of his children have complained of being embarrassed by him. “Oh yeah, all the time,” he said, adding that they “don’t care” that their father is Robert De Niro. In a later conversation with King, he said the couple were “over the moon” in welcoming their newest addition.</p><p>Chen is a martial arts instructor and apparently, she and De Niro met while filming The Intern together, a buddy-comedy movie in which he starred alongside Anne Hathaway. It was written and directed by Nancy Meyers. They sparked romance rumors while being spotted on a PDA-filled vacation in the south of France in August 2021. They were later pictured kissing on a yacht in photographs obtained by the Daily Mail (see <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">them here</a>); the 108m, $200 million boat was owned by Australian billionaire James Packer and De Niro’s business partner who was once engaged to Mariah Carey.</p><p>On Tuesday, May 9, 2023, De Niro’s rep confirmed to Page Six that the actor had welcomed this seventh child at 79. He’d previously made headlines after correcting an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ET Canada reporter</a> who said he was a father of six, clarifying he’d “just had a baby”. “I know you have six kids,” the reporter stared, but De Niro interrupted with “Seven, actually.” “I just had a baby,” he revealed. “I mean, there’s no way around it with kids. I don’t like to have to lay down the law and stuff like that. But, [sometimes] you just have no choice,” he explained in the interview. “And any parent, I think, would say the same thing. You always want to do the right thing by the children and give them the benefit of the doubt but sometimes you can’t.”</p><p>While stepping out at the premiere for his latest film About My Father, Page Six asked if he was surprised to be a dad again. “No,” he replied flatly, adding that the pregnancy was “planned”. He added, “How you could not plan that kind of thing?” He didn’t confirm who the mother was but in late March 2023, Chen was shown to be sporting a baby bump in footage captured by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">X17Online</a>. He then told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Extra</a> on welcoming his new bundle of joy: “I’m ok with it. I’m good with it.” Though, he added that it “never gets easier.”</p><p>The actor’s other&nbsp;About My Father co-star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sebastian Maniscalco</a> congratulated the legendary actor on the newest addition to his family. “I was informed today that he had the baby I didn’t know leading up to this that he was going to have a baby but uh yeah God bless him,” Maniscalco told&nbsp;Extra. “He’s a very soft-spoken individual who loves to spend time with his family and I’m happy for him.”</p><p>“My jaw dropped when I heard he had another child,” writer Shawn Levy, author of 2014’s De Niro: A Life, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> in response to the news. “I mean he’s going to be 102 when the kid graduates from college. I think it’s crazy. At the same time, I have to say he is absolutely a great dad. In fact, one of the signature accomplishments of his life is keeping his kids and ex-partners close.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-950497032.jpg><p>Chen opened up about how she lost all facial functions after she gave birth.”When I went home, I started to feel like … my tongue felt strange,” she told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> CBS News’ Gayle King</a>. “It felt a little tingly, just starting to get a little bit numb. And then I realized my face just felt weird. I didn’t know what the feeling was that I was having. It felt weird.”</p><p>“Did it look different to you? Your face when you looked in the mirror?” King asks Chen. “Yeah,” she responds. “When I got home, it was like everything was starting to just fall down on itself. Like, my face was melting on itself,” Chen explains. “And then a week after giving birth, that was when it all hit. And I called my doctor, and I … was trying to eat.”</p><p>She continues, “I went to put a fork of food in my mouth and everything came out. I couldn’t eat. And then I was starting to slur. So I said, ‘There’s something really going on here.’ “</p><p>The mother was told, “‘Go right to the hospital.’ [The hospital] admitted me. And I lost all facial function the minute I got into the hospital,” she says.</p><p>Chen and De Niro’s romance came shortly after his split from his wife of 20 years, Grace Hightower. In a statement after the split made on November 27, 2018, the Oscar-winning actor told <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a> that it was a “difficult” time but they remained committed to co-parenting their two children. “Grace and I have two beautiful children together. We are entering a period of transition in our relationship which is a difficult but constructive process,” he said. De Niro added, “I honor Grace as a wonderful mother and ask for privacy and respect from all as we proceed to develop our roles as partners in parenting.”</p><p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://katiecouric.com/entertainment/>Katie Couric Media,</a> the sex drive for men <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://katiecouric.com/lifestyle/relationships/how-does-aging-affect-sex-drive-men-women/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">changes drastically</a> when growing old compared to women. “For men, changes like a reduction in testosterone happen slowly,” explains Dr. Regina Koepp. This is a process called “andropause” — a natural lowering of testosterone with age.</p><p>“Some men may experience a change in sex drive or other types of sexual dysfunctions, while other men might not see any type of change,” says Dr. Hoffman. “Also prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, requires treatments that can lead to sexual side effects.”</p><p>De Niro also has four grandchildren, three from Raphael and one from Drena. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Cigar Aficionado</a> in 2015, the actor said he had no plans of slowing down, personally or professionally. “I don’t really think of retirement because I don’t know what else I would do other than do what I’m doing, I guess. I don’t feel, and you can tell me how you feel, but I don’t feel really much older than I think,” he said. “I look at myself, I’m not even used to looking at myself as being older. It’s a little disconcerting if you see somebody you’ve known in your 30s or 40s or even 50s who has not aged well or just got older. That’s life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png><p><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

"But it is crazy because I am a Taurus and he is an Aquarius, and every single thing I read said, 'Don't even do it. It is the absolute worst pairing.'"</p><p>Tish, 56, explained that while she is very easily offended and often takes "things so personally," Purcell, 54, on the other hand is "just very blunt."</p><p>"There is no warm and fuzzy," she added.</p><p>As an only child who was adopted, Tish said that's an element of their relationship she has been kind of missing.</p><p>"I was an only child, I was adopted, so I was coddled a lot. So I kind of have needed that. But that's just not who he is. He is not emotional," she explained. "And that could be a problem."</p><p>Their differences, however, has made her grow, telling listeners, "But you know what, this is where I've grown, is like, I just feel like instead now of me getting so offended, because I respect and love him, that we have conversations. And instead [of] getting so upset and heated about it, and me not taking it personally, just letting him have an opinion. I've never been good at that."</p><p>While the issues are there, Tish said they are worth working through.</p><p>"These are definitely issues. But issues also, because I love him, that I'm dealing with," the mother of five explained, before noting that the growth she's had since marrying The Flash star "is crazy."</p><p>Tish's comments about the issues in her marriage to Purcell come not long after it was reported that her daughter, <a href=#><strong>Noah Cyrus</strong></a>, 24, whom she shares with ex-husband, <a href=#><strong>Billy Ray Cyrus</strong></a>, had dated Purcell before Tish met and married him.</p><p>Per a source close to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>People</strong></a>, Noah had been casually seeing Purcell before his relationship with Tish.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3f6773ca-639e-48a1-8691-343371d3253d data-container-ref=toofab:article:3e75ef71-6ac9-4cee-a1a4-fa8d9656f6e8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/70/5by4/2024/02/08/70ef4b7dd25742b482d379a00ed4f276_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tish Cyrus Shares What's Different About Her Marriage to Dominic Purcell: 'He Encourages Me to Fly'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Noah and Dominic were seeing each other in a friends with benefits way, off and on.

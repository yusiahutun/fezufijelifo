In contrast to other popular hiking spots, this place is located in an inconspicuous area in the city. As a girl who grew up in Lam Tin, I have visited the park with my family many times. Senior citizens and retirees who live in the district love to gather there to go for a long walk. Besides, there are a lot of old buildings in the area which take you back to the city’s good old days.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Janice Cheung Hei-ching, 12, St Paul’s Co-educational College:</span></strong><span type=text> Pineapple Mountain, also known as the “mini-Grand Canyon”, in Tuen Mun. It offers breathtaking scenery; you can see panoramic views of the New Territories, including villages in Tuen Mun, and even have a glimpse of the skyscrapers in Shenzhen. Pineapple Mountain is also a perfect place for hikers seeking a challenge because some parts of the “canyon” can be slippery and the trail is completely exposed to the sun. It stands out as one of the best places to hike.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Pineapple Mountain in Tuen Mun is famous for its rugged paths.

It is a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of a densely packed neighbourhood. This short hike also affords great views of the district and some people are known to climb the 90-metre hill during their lunch break. It is also one of the best locations where you can watch the sunset and enjoy the city’s landscape.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Kaden Chan Chi-lok, 16, St Joan of Arc Secondary School:</span></strong><span type=text> Braemar Hill. It is close to my school and I can see many hikers through my classroom window every day. The journey to the top can be quite challenging because you have to climb a lot of stairs. Along the way, you might even come across wild boars which could pose problems. But the impressive view at the top of the mountain will make you feel like you are the king of the world.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=783d2dd9-82dd-4aa2-bc50-2dc2ce2f0a32 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>The street foods that best represent Hong Kong</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Ryan Wang Yiyao, 13, Pui Kiu College:</span></strong><span type=text> Sunset Peak on Lantau Island, the third-highest mountain in Hong Kong. The amazing view from the top will make the tough climb worth it. It is a great place to watch the seas of golden silvergrass in autumn and winter. It takes about four hours to finish the 7km hike.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Violet Chan Tsz-yan, 12, Pooi To Middle School:</span></strong><span type=text> We have heard since childhood that Hong Kong people have the “Lion Rock spirit”. As long as you choose the right route, the Lion Rock hike is not difficult. Starting from Lok Fu Station, you can climb to the top in less than two hours, and enjoy the epic view over Kowloon all the way to Central on Hong Kong Island.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">A view of Lion Rock from Tai Mo Shan.

Although the name may sound scary, it’s a family-friendly hike and the views are spectacular. Before becoming one of the city’s most popular recreational spots, Devil’s Peak was home to ferocious pirates during the Ming dynasty (1368-1643) and a British military base in the 20th century. Hikers enjoy the short, steep climb to the top of the mountain, which is around 220 metres tall. At the summit of Devil’s Peak, you can see both Hong Kong Island and Kowloon.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Che Zihao, 13, Ho Yu College and Primary School (Sponsored by Sik Sik Yuen):</span></strong><span type=text> Dragon’s Back in Shek O. It is a great place to hike for beginners, offering lush trees, sandy beaches, and the sea. The hike ends at Big Wave Bay, where you can have a relaxing meal at one of the many beachfront restaurants.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=e1962796-da6a-4ca2-b187-afc119a6d2a5 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>If you could design a slogan to represent Hong Kong, what would it be?</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Hebe Ng Suet-man, 15, Buddhist Tai Hung College:</span></strong><span type=text> Tai Mo Shan, the tallest mountain in Hong Kong. I have been to Tai Mo Shan Country Park twice. The first time I went there, I had a barbecue with my family. It was very quiet and we had a pleasant experience there. Then I went hiking – for the first time ever. There are many ways of hiking Tai Mo Shan. The trail we took wasn’t too difficult and the view was breathtaking. We could see the entire city from the top of the mountain.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Ng Wing-chi, 15, Pok Oi Hospital 80th Anniversary Tang Ying Hei College:</span></strong><span type=text> The Peak – one of the most popular tourist destinations in Hong Kong. It is the tallest hill on Hong Kong Island, and offers a 360-degree view across Victoria Harbour, Kowloon and outlying islands. In about three hours, we went from a crowded urban area to a stunning mountaintop trail. Hong Kong is a city like no other in the world.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxrF7w6KqnKemmr9wxc6uqWaun56wpnvAq6uim5yafHR%2BkGxna21fqbyxeZBpZLCglaeybq7ErKtmqJyWsKZ5x6KinmWYpLuoecqopaA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

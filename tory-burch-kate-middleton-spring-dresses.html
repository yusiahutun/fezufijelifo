It was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tory Burch</a>'s SS22 show and she shut down all of Mercer street to create an open-air market with booths from a handful of local businesses. You could pick up a croissant from Balthazar, a coffee from Peddler, or a book from McNally Jackson before heading to your seat on the sidewalk. New Yorkers would hang out on their fire escape above in anticipation of the line of models that would momentarily come strutting down the cobblestone street, having accidentally secured a front row seat to one of the biggest NYFW shows.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was so happy I could barely contain my excitement or my wide grin while I sat in awe of the show, which ended with a live song accompanied by interpretive dance and a drummer. But what really stuck with me was not just the perfect and very New York bubble Tory Burch had created for 10 minutes on this special street downtown, but the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">stunning dresses</a> that were a quintessential uniform for her world.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$1,198; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">toryburch.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They were colorful and gorgeous, but more importantly, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">they looked</a> so comfortable and flattering in a way few dresses often do. As the models walked down the street, the colorful printed fabric flowed perfectly with each step, and it looked exactly like what you'd see a chic New Yorker wear on her way to grab avocado toast and flat whites with friends at Ruby's. It's the type of dress you'd remember all day after spotting it on a stranger, only to wish you'd asked where it was from.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I instantly knew they'd be a hit, and just eight days into spring, I'm already proven correct. At Tory's FW22 show, the coolest 'It' girls wore dresses from the previous collection. Namely Devon Lee Carlson, Salem Mitchell, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katie Holmes</a>. Just sitting in the audience, I heard fashion editors from every publication admiring the dresses from afar and debating which ones to add to their cart. Now, a handful of them are already available, although <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kate Middleton</a> made sure to sell out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a blue floral-print poplin midi</a>. But that's exactly the kind of effect these dresses have on everyone who sees them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For my own wardrobe, I've already acquired <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Tory Burch's Tulle Crinoline skirt</a>, and it's by far the most gorgeous skirt I've ever bought. If I had it my way (and the budget), I'd also instantly buy the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">picnic plaid McCardell dress</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">the Diamond Topstitch Sailor dress</a>. And I'm telling you, you absolutely should do the same. Every and any Tory Burch dress available now is bound to be an 'It' dress soon, and you'll without a doubt wear it all spring and summer. It's only a matter of weeks before Middleton or Holmes (or more realistically, both) wear another <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Tory Burch dress</a> and sell it out completely. So act fast and secure one of spring's biggest 'It' items now, before it's too late.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shop the best spring dresses by Tory Burch below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y1u9GyZJutopi1brfArZxmpZmZsa2x06ilZqugp7avs4ydqZ6ro5rA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

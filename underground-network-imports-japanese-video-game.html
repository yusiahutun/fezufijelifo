Suddenly, the dolly’s wheels slid off the edge. His whole body spilled forward and the arcade cabinet plunged to the ground with a fractious crash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/18/a98e49ac-e534-4ebf-bdf5-2cb8adb4b475_0e2c23f9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under the video Arrington uploaded to Twitter, gamers expressed their alarm. “This is the scariest thing I’ve seen on the internet,” said one. “I don’t think my a**hole has ever puckered harder,” said another, vividly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Watching the video from across the country in Brooklyn, New York, I screamed. It was my machine.</p>This is not like a Cadillac from the ’60s or ’70s, where people are making parts for itPhil ArringtonArrington chose his moment to explain himself, and it was a couple of days later, live on streaming website <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Twitch</span></a>, squatting, fishing out the dusty remnants from a bag of Flamin’ Hot Doritos. His tone was not contrite. He had intentionally cut the video at its most dramatic moment, he said. The machine was, in fact, intact.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arrington stood up, revealing athletic short-shorts, and, tossing the bag of Hot Doritos aside, made his way over to the Museca cabinet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Museca was a glowing anime beacon. A neon red coil shot up through its base like a spine, supporting a console of five pastel-lit buttons, each the size of an adult hand. To the rhythm of a peppy beat, a player would press and spin these buttons at just the right time to amass points – that is, if the game worked. The cabinet, thankfully, had booted into a menu screen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you get some­thing like this, you’ve got to take care of it. This is not like a Cadillac from the ’60s or ’70s, where people are making parts for it,” said Arrington. He pressed Start. The display went blank. “Oh s***,” he said. But then baby-voice pop music blared from the speakers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Never mind.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/18/c200c3c1-28e9-4936-90fc-8c3f8f23ef12_f86367d5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These days, Museca is an extraordinary find, Arrington said. Like the other machines Arrington helps import, it is primarily sold to and played at arcades in Japan. On top of that, Museca’s publisher, Konami, discontinued the game a few years ago. The machines were recalled from across Japan, and their parts repurposed into an entirely new game called Bishi Bashi. Not many Museca cabinets survived, making them a particular prize for devoted fans of Japan’s storied arcade scene.</p><a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The country’s pleasure palaces have attracted millions of native and foreign otaku</span></a> (generally describing people who are addicted to cartoons and comics) for decades, luring them in with the promise of competition and escape for the price of just one 100-yen coin. Taito Corporation’s Space Invaders marked the industry’s launch in 1978, and in the following years, Japan’s arcade scene blossomed, giving rise to classics such as Donkey Kong, Contra and Street Fighter II.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tens of thousands of arcades sprang up, packed tight with crane games filled with wide-eyed Pokémon plushies; shimmering fantasy role-playing or strategy games; scuffed-up fighting games; and, of course, the full-body high of rhythm games such as Konami’s Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) or Museca.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some titles, such as DDR, got officially licensed or released overseas, where they have become cultural touchstones. But Konami, Taito and other arcade-game makers designed their best stuff exclusively for Japan, on idiosyncratic arcade hardware that was meant to stay there.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They don’t want these machines to be sold outside Japan,” says Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese consulting company Kantan Games. A lot of machines, including Museca, stipulate on their title screens that they are only meant to be played in Japan. In recent years, publishers such as Konami have enforced this by ensuring their arcade games only function when networked to their proprietary server with a proprietary protocol.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/02/08/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:11</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Game on: new centre in Japan helps seniors connect with others through gaming</p><p>Game on: new centre in Japan helps seniors connect with others through gaming</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The logistics and price of licensing is a big reason – music, distribution and payment. It’s also a commercial calculation, Toto adds. “The arcade machines are not stand-alone any more – they have to be connected to a server, which makes maintaining them, controlling them, and operating them more complex. They don’t want the hassle of providing that knowledge and those maintenance services to companies outside Japan.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lately, the Japanese arcade chain Round1 has opened locations across the United States; but outside those, the typical American has almost no access to the thousands of authentic arcade machines that brought glory to Japan as the holy land of gaming.</p>Today, though, Japan’s arcades are in crisis. <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Game centres are closing with heartbreaking rapidity</span></a>, due in part to competition from home gaming consoles and a tax increase that raised the price of a single play. Between 2006 and 2016, the number of arcades fell from 24,000 to 14,000.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Covid-19 accelerated this trend, emptying the arcades of regulars and tourists alike. Between October 1 and November 24, 2021, 20 arcades closed in Japan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When arcades close, their video games face one of three fates, only two of which are sanctioned by a Japanese trade association of game manufacturers. The first is getting junked in a landfill. The second is getting gutted and sold for pieces, and then junked in a landfill. (Arrington calls this “the mafia treatment”.)</p>For three two-minute sessions, its flashing lights and spinney buttons demanded my full-body attention, crowbarred me from reality and unleashed me into the bliss vortexCecilia D’Anastasio<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Finally, the third: a Japanese distributor swoops in and buys up all of a dying arcade’s machines. Some get sent around Japan to smaller arcades. Others, on the down-low, are sourced to enterprising Westerners such as Arrington, a self-described “muscle guy” for the grey-market entrepreneurs who import thousands of cabinets from Japan every year.</p>Over the past five years, as Japanese arcade machines have become more available than ever, Western demand for Japanese machines has exploded. To support that demand, an underground network of gamers has risen to the challenge of evacuating these cabinets from <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Japan</span></a>, hauling them across the world, and hacking their code so fans like me can finally, after all these years, play.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like a lot of bad ideas, my obsession with Museca began at a Long Island mall.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That mall was one of the lucky few with an American Round1 arcade, and in a far corner, I found Museca blasting bass and beckoning in Japanese. For three two-minute sessions, its flashing lights and spinney buttons demanded my full-body attention, crowbarred me from reality and unleashed me into the bliss vortex.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It would be so nice, I thought, to dip into that bliss vortex without having to drive to Long Island. And so funny, I thought, if I owned my own Museca machine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In no world was this a reasonable idea. I live in a Brooklyn flat with a cat and a large adult boyfriend. Surely it would be prohibitively expensive. And there would be no way to ensure the machine I bought actually worked, or that if it broke, I could fix it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/02/08/clean_0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After months of waffling, and months separated from the Long Island Museca machine, I finally acquiesced to this most absurd whim, giving myself permission, maybe in a state of lockdown-induced mania, to become obsessed with finding it, or finding the people who could.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I began by scouring niche arcade forums and emailing arcade distributors in Japan. Everybody who bothered to reply said Museca was dead and gone. By last summer, I had resorted to tweeting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yikes. I’ve seen only 2 for sale this last year, and the other one was £4,000 (US$5,400)!,” wrote a British collector named MechaCrash in a direct message. Then, a couple days later: “I got a tip from someone.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">MechaCrash passed me on to Arrington, aka BossSalad, who had heard that this other guy, who goes by Koun, was importing a Museca cabinet in a container ship somewhere between Japan and Long Beach. Arrington would deal with Koun and get it to me, he said, for a reasonable price.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arrington has always gone to great lengths for these games, and he understands intimately why others do, too. Back where he grew up in “South ‘crack epidemic’ Central Los Angeles”, he says, arcade machines were limited to laundromats and liquor stores. Arrington encountered his first DDR machine at the Santa Monica pier.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">This dock promises to turn your Switch into an arcade cabinet</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At first, he was baffled by the idea of operating a video game with his feet, but after he found some of his mother’s most-played songs in the menu, he was lost to euphoria.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To take on the one DDR machine he knew of in his area, Arrington would travel three hours by bus to a mall many towns over. Against the background of peppy Japanese tracks, he’d stomp DDR’s floor pads until his body hurt, committing his mind to memorising the steps, and return home too tired to move.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arrington’s mother lent her support, figuring it was, probably, healthy. “She watched a lot of parents bury their kids, especially their sons,” says Arrington. “There were two ways to survive. You blend in the environment or you stay off the streets. That’s where video games came in.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although American enthusiasts have been importing games from Japan for decades, the process is a multi-tiered quest. In the beginning, the operation was helter-skelter and scrappy, involving coordinating “group buys” over niche forums and instant messaging channels. If interested buyers could get a contact in Japan to email them back, they then had to curry demand for up to 20 to 40 cabinets – enough to fill a US$3,000 shipping container.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Months later, after a journey across the world, those cabinets might all end up at a house in New Jersey, where the gamers would park their U-Hauls, check their wares, clean the smell of cigarettes off their machines, and drag them home like a winter fox with a hare.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/18/02f5d640-219c-49bf-bfb7-bebaf83f0408_1da159da.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By about 2016, the American arcade importing scene was becoming more professional – or more accurately, less amateur. The task of networking with Japanese distributors, organising shipping containers and fixing broken cabinets, combined with a surge in demand from Japan-obsessed gamers, had created space for something like an industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One guy named David Rocovits, aka Cereth, aka Kenchan, worked the West Coast out of Reno, Nevada. Another group worked the East. And then there was this guy Koun, who covers everywhere, if spottily.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He sells garbage and everybody knows it,” Rocovits said after a particularly brutal invective. Sources said he might send over the wrong machine and ask the recipients to just sell it themselves. He’ll send out the right one right after, no problem, even pay for shipping. (Koun declined multiple requests for comment. However, I should note that I did, in fact, receive a Museca cabinet.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2017, Arrington got laid off from his job as a librarian and was “working the apps”, he says, delivering meals, goods, whatever. After finally saving up US$10,000, he bought his first cabinet: a game called Pump It Up. (Asked who from, Arrington just says, “I’m supposed to say ‘a distributor’. We’ll keep it at that.” He says it retailed for US$15,000).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Living in his “bachelor’s-pad-slash-sister’s-garage”, Arrington became obsessed with tinkering with Japanese arcade machines, buying them on Craigslist, fixing them up, flipping them, sometimes accidentally setting them on fire and discreetly dumping them on the side of the road.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘The world’s worst video game’ was set in Hong Kong. Here are some others</span></p></a></h3>Soon enough, he amassed a collection, some of them bought from Rocovits. The two men met in person at MAGWest, a music and <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">gaming convention</span></a> that had paid Arrington US$2,000 to haul out his personal menagerie. Rocovits convinced him to make a clean break from his life in the gig economy and go into business with him.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ever since, Arrington has helped Rocovits unpack and move stock in that Ford pickup. By 2019, Rocovits was importing a 40-foot shipping container every two to three months from a distributor in Kobe, Osaka or Tokyo, each one packed tight with up to 45 cabinets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One container set him back about US$3,500 for shipping and US$40,000 for the machines. In 2020, things picked up to the tune of three to four containers a month. Last year, Rocovits estimates, he brought in more than 1,000 machines, with a total value of over US$1.5 million. “It was back-breaking.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And right as demand increased, a global supply chain crisis hit. Now, his port-to-port cost for shipping a container from Japan is US$13,000. Rocovits says that some of his guys in Japan won’t even send him containers or quote him on a price, as it can exceed US$25,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yeah, I mean, I guess if you look at it compared to other industries,” says Rocovits, “it’s not very good.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/18/29aca228-fd76-4258-ba27-4c2151c30def_0e2c23f9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the containers come in from Long Beach to Reno, Rocovits, with a sort of Indiana Jones swagger, films himself climbing through the heaped-up machines. His company’s name, Game Saru, comes from this tradition: “Saru” means “monkey” in Japanese.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trekking through dozens of plastic-wrapped cabinets towards the back, his shoes make sticky sounds stepping over Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Terminal to get to Astro City and a twin set of Jubeats – destined, probably, for a personal home or underground arcade. The unclaimed ones might show up in a Facebook Marketplace post, or go to some desperate Twitter user like me.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My Museca cabinet sailed into Long Beach at the end of September, wrapped many times over in cellophane and covered in a thin layer of dust. In an apologetic message, Arrington told me I’d have to wait a little longer before it arrived in Brooklyn. To explain why, he shared screenshots of a conversation with Rocovits, who was absolutely frantic. “Can you be in Reno by tomorrow morning? Kind of an emergency.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arrington had been on the move for months, delivering Japanese gaming machines to Seattle, Colorado, Northern California, Nevada, Texas – each one for between US$1,000 and US$6,000, plus Arrington’s fee. At other times, he was driving his own little circus of Japanese arcade machines to conventions around the country, for nostalgic weebs (non-Japanese people obsessed with Japanese culture) and weirdos to beep and bop on.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Fitness 3.0? How active gaming and blockchain will in meet the metaverse</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now, Rocovits desperately needed Arrington to hop on the first flight over, rent a 26-foot box truck, fill it with Japanese arcade cabinets stored at Rocovits’ 4,000 sq ft (370 sq m) warehouse, drive them to Southern California, unload the games, load up some more games, and rush back to an arcade convention in Las Vegas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arrington dutifully cancelled all of his obligations, but told Rocovits he was worried that, financially, “this could break us”. Recently, a buyer put their order for a US$50,000 container on ice; Rocovits had two weeks to get the funds together to cover it. “F*** my bottom end with this,” said Rocovits. “It’s not about money. I need manpower.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In October, I sent Arrington enough money for a high-end PC over PayPal. It felt insane. Yes, in Arrington’s video, Museca looked like it worked. But between the San Pedro warehouse and Brooklyn, anything could happen, Arrington reminded me. Rare or irreplaceable parts could shake loose. Software could glitch out. Buttons could crack.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arrington sent a photo of two movers papering the cabinet in cardboard and wrapping it tight. “They will call you day-of, with no 24 hours warning,” Arrington said. While I waited, Arrington recommended I talk to “the Museca guy”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/18/5a9a1be0-3f06-46e6-89c8-df1bcfef734e_de871001.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For every Japanese arcade game that escapes the country, there is at least one “guy”. And without that guy – or girl, as a number of women do this, too – the DDR cabinet you just imported will, upon arrival, be no more than a US$6,000 doorstop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Museca, like many other Konami games, is designed to only work in a Japanese arcade with an internet connection to Konami’s proprietary server, e-Amuse. The machine required a handshake, or authentication, with e-Amuse, or it wouldn’t boot at all. And Konami doesn’t just hand out those handshakes to Maggie Museca in Minnesota or David DDR in South Dakota.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Konami discontinued Museca in 2018, though, it granted the game a rare “offline kit”, conveyed in the form of a USB stick. Finally, it could boot without e-Amuse. In exchange, though, the kit removed some of what made Museca fun: new songs, a leader board, an easy way to skip through the gruellingly long intro.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Museca offline leaves a lot to be desired,” says Cammy, who is the Museca guy. “Most of the songs are locked, you can’t save any of your settings or progress, and you’ll never get any new official updates.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China upgrades its internet cafes for esports gaming hotels</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a direct message over Discord, Cammy will gamely share his Museca modification, Museca. Plus, which replaces the game’s original code and adds in lost features, plus an English translation. Publicly, he will defend Museca to the death. He had written one of the angrier tweets at Arrington after his trolley video. (Enjoying the drama, Arrington tweeted a video of himself loading a DDR machine twice his size into his truck: “When I strike the heart of [Cammy] and he don’t realise who the Boss is.”)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Japanese game publishers have taken great pains to make sure their machines work only in Japan and Southeast Asia, with few exceptions. Online authentication is now almost ubiquitous. (Importantly, it also lets publishers take a cut of a machine’s revenue and update their games remotely.) Encryption is common. Sometimes players need a security dongle or a passcode to get a Japanese arcade game going.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In its privileged position as a Japanese arcade with US locations, Round1 can connect to an official VPN that allows Americans to play games. But Maggie Museca and David DDR are out of luck.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most of these services are unavailable or locked away for anything that was legally imported,” says one hacker we’ll call Dominic, who helps make Japanese arcade games work outside Japan. “Which is why private owners have to look elsewhere to get their games running.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/18/7d8bec15-c68b-460d-b987-4f57c3309ab6_5eeb8f55.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To bring life to these machines, or rather preserve the life they once had, an international network of hackers and modifiers has charitably decrypted, spoofed or brute-forced their way into these games. It’s a necessary evil or an unnecessary good, depending on how you look at it; for publishers, the term might be “illegal”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fearing their lawyers, most sources involved in this side of the business asked to speak off the record or anonymously. Others reserve an open pride in their work not as hackers, but as preservationists – librarians of an art form that they believe deserves to be shielded from corporate whims.</p>A decade ago, Dominic worked alongside the ragtag team of arcade <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">hackers</span></a> called Programmed World, which undertook the task of making e-Amuse work on arcade machines internationally, for free. A private donor supplied the team with enough money to cover initial server costs; Japanese arcade workers furnished the group with game data, which Programmed World affiliates decrypted and reverse-engineered, he says.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Programmed World members magnanimously handed out game data and instructions to American rhythm game buyers who had managed to find them through friends-of-friends. Sometimes, the hacks went to American arcade business owners who were desperate to get their grey-market attractions to function.</p>We do our best to bring an authentic Japanese experience, stuff that you literally couldn’t get anywhere else in AmericaJames Chance<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a 2011 announcement, Programmed World named nine arcades across the US and Italy that were already on its private network. “Things were pushed privately to people who had cabinets on the networks, but it was required that they had real cabinets and hardware and such,” says Dominic. “They wouldn’t give it to you if you weren’t running a real set-up.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Programmed World disbanded in 2015, after Konami served the group with a cease-and-desist order. But Japanese publishers haven’t been able to stop the overseas appetite for their games. Round1, which is based in Osaka, today has nearly 50 locations in the US where, under Konami’s auspices, and on their official VPN, Americans can button-mash their way through Japanese games to their hearts’ and wallets’ content.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">James Chance, a senior game technician for Round1 who opens new stores, says, “We still have the kind of stuff that you’d expect in an American arcade, like, you know, we have all the ticket games. But we also do our best to bring an authentic Japanese experience, stuff that you literally couldn’t get anywhere else in America.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the same time, though, the closing of so many arcades in Japan has flooded the market with games. Only a small percentage are headed for a Round1. It’s why Arrington and Rocovits are still in business. And why, in the tradition of Programmed World, a new crop of hackers have established their presence over Discord servers, which buyers track down to find their “guy”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We just wanted to help people get the arcade machines they paid for working,” a hacker who asked to be called Albida says. Some hackers and modifiers told me that they fervently believe, without them, significantly more of these games would end up in landfills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/18/99803c2b-bd05-4a9a-aacd-86e340ffd0c0_0e2c23f9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And while they declined to speak on the record about how they receive Japanese games’ data today, they did note that, to prove their dedication to preservation, they do not on principle provide hacks for games’ most contemporary software versions. They also don’t work with people attempting to emulate the games on PCs or hardware other than the original. That way, Japanese arcades still have the one-up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We care for the arcade industry as a whole,” says Albida. “We’re sad to see all the arcades closed, especially because I really love the arcade industry and the arcade feeling myself. But when we see tons of ‘cabs’ coming over here, then, of course, we are happy to see that happen.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some importers will throw their hands in the air in feigned ignorance when asked how to break into the machines. Arrington just wants to get his customers their games and leave it to them to get them working. Other times, importers and hackers work tightly together.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Abigail Davis, who runs an import business spanning the East Coast, met her best friend, a hacker named Gwen who goes by Helvetica, as a disgruntled employee at an Ohio arcade. Frustrated with her boss’ lack of enthusiasm for Japanese games, Davis went into business on her own. Helvetica, who sharpened her coding skills getting the Ohio arcade’s Japanese machines to work, began taking on Davis’ wares, too.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">In China, Singapore and South Korea, gaming’s dark side put under spotlight</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Soon, she made a name for herself as one of the top rhythm game hackers in the US, and, according to Davis, among the first people to spoof e-Amuse after Programmed World shut down. (Helvetica died in 2020.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Gwen and I have very different skill sets,” Davis told me while driving a 26-foot truck full of arcade machines back from Maryland’s MAGFest in January. Cammy was seated in the truck behind her. “It literally could not have happened if she wasn’t helping out on the software side. I wouldn’t have even started if I didn’t have her helping out with everything. If we just bring the cabinets over as is, they’d be bricks.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If Museca didn’t work, it would be less like a brick and more like 10 breeze blocks. Movers wheeled the cabinet into my flat last October. Situated in the living room, Museca seemed obscene and a little unholy, like an icon from a church overseas. It was stunning, though, and nearly new, with just 002339 plays, a ticker read. It did not turn on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Likely a blown fuse in the PSU,” or power supply unit, Cammy guessed over a Discord direct message. It was. Fuse changed and powered on, Museca lit up with lines and lines of code, which, Cammy explained, I might want to replace with his.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“WARNING,” my Museca cabinet now reads in English. “This game is for sale and use in Japan only.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/18/89cca5df-1eb2-4d38-bcf3-a5818f29df6a_a5180479.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Playing a six-foot-tall Museca machine at home is a particular gaming experience, to put it lightly. Today, gaming consoles are designed to seamlessly integrate into our lives. Candy Crush on our phones when we commute to work. Stardew Valley on the Nintendo Switch on the way home, and then on our televisions. League of Legends or the Xbox App on the same computer we use for our day jobs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It may be a figment of my imagination, some soon-to-fade feeling from the effort it took to obtain it, but Museca’s bliss vortex, to me, is a function of its singularity. It demands a fracture with routine and reality. Standing before it, eyes straining under its light and ears ringing with ecstatic trance music, is a total communion with a game that, at least in my home, exists for the sole purpose of entertaining me, right in that place and at that moment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Up until it arrived in my flat, Museca was a commercial object. It was a symbol of an ebbing industry overseas. It was a memory from my time at Round1 and, briefly, a six-foot-tall doorstop. In my home, ridiculously and improbably, Museca is the silliest thing I own – and, with no strings attached, a very good video game I play way too much, whenever I want.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOpaann12nsqKw0miYq6yZmLmme5JqbXBtZmp8trrDnqmgqp%2Bqu6V5zZ6rsKeioHqquc%2Boqa2rXZ%2Busa3NnqqeZaaesaa7jKCYpp0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

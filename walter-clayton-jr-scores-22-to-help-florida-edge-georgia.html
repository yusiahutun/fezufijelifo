Tyrese Samuel added 17 points and 15 rebounds and Will Richard had 17 points and seven rebounds for the Gators (22-10). Zyon Pullin had 11 points and eight assists before fouling out and Alex Condon added 10 points for Florida. The Gators will face third-seeded Alabama on Friday night. Silas Demary Jr. and Noah Thomasson scored 14 points apiece for Georgia (17-16). Justin Hill and RJ Melendez had 13 apiece for the Bulldogs. Georgia trailed by six before Hill scored five straight points to cut Florida's lead to 74-73 with 2:46 left. The Bulldogs had a chance to take the lead but Clayton stole the ball, drove for the layup, was fouled and hit the free throw to give the Gators a four-point edge with 1:55 remaining. Richard's layup made it 79-74 with 1:04 left but Georgia hung around. Hill's driving hoop pulled the Bulldogs within 83-80 with 6.4 seconds to play before Riley Kugel made two free throws with 5.3 seconds left to wrap it up for Florida. Florida shot 43.8 percent from the field, including 6 of 17 from 3-point range. Samuel made just nine of 23 free-throw attempts. The Bulldogs made 42.4 percent of their attempts and were 8 of 19 from behind the arc.

Kugel capped it with a floater as Florida held a 53-49 lead with 11:19 left. Thomasson hit another trey 20 seconds later but the Gators responded with five more points. The last two came after Georgia coach Mike White was called for a technical foul and Clayton knocked down both attempts to make it 58-52 with 10:26 left. Florida led 66-58 after Clayton's 3-pointer with 8:18 left before the Bulldogs rattled off 10 of the next 12 points to tie the score at 68 on a layup by Demary with 5:12 remaining.

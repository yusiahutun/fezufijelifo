If you’re wondering why you feel completely out of your wits, know that it’s just not you. Eclipse season has reached its peak, and whether you’re ready or not, the cosmos are a hard-launching new era.</p><p>When I say this week will be intense, that’s almost an understatement. It all begins with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a total solar eclipse in Aries</a> on April 8, which bring forth a bold burst of change that speeds you up toward your ultimate destiny. Get ready for next level emotional tension, as this eclipse lands at the same degree as Chiron—the wounded healer—which means you’ll will be traversing the most vulnerable regions of your heart. However, it will also give you the tools to heal what needs healing, forcing you to reckon with what remains unresolved.</p><p>As <a href=#>powerhouse Mars</a> joins forces with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">disciplinary Saturn</a> on April 10, you may feel like you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. And as this conjunction lands in confounding and imaginative Pisces, you may feel even more confused about how to proceed. Pressures are mounting, as though you’re taking energetic beatings from all sides. However, this energy will help you tap into your resilience and forge something as impenetrable as iron. Remember, we become our strongest after we realize how much more we’re capable of surviving and defeating.</p><p>As if you needed another kicker, Mercury <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>is currently still retrograde</a>, and because it takes place in Aries, it’s making us all want to fight and argue. And as <a href=#>the </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aries sun</a> joins forces with Mercury retrograde on April 11, this frustrating and disorienting energy will be emphasized, as Mercury will technically be “combust”. But not before a brilliant Mercury cazimi clears away the fog, activating powerful insights and psychic downloads. Get ready to cleanse your whole perspective of the past, present, and future this week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising&nbsp;sign</a>&nbsp;(and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.2046632124352><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_aries.png><p>This week, a new direction opens up for you.</p><p>The week begins on Monday, April 8, with a solar eclipse in your own sign of Aries.

If you're wondering what TPU is, we're going to (figuratively) break it down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-s-a-thermoplastic>What's a Thermoplastic?</h2><p>Plastic, as you probably know, is a (usually) synthetic material made from synthetic polymers. Polymers are substances made up of monomers. <a href=#>Monomer</a> molecules form long chains with their neighbors, creating huge macromolecules.</p><p>Plasticity&nbsp;is the property that gives plastics their name. To be plastic simply means that a solid material can be permanently deformed. Plastics can be reshaped by molding, extruding, or applying pressure.</p><p>Thermoplastics get their name from how they react to heat. Thermoplastics become plastic at certain temperatures, which is when they are shaped as needed. When they cool down, their new shape becomes permanent until they are heated up again.</p><p>The temperatures needed to make thermoplastics pliable are much higher than, for example, your phone will ever be subjected to. So there's little chance that a thermoplastic product will lose its shape during normal use.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pin Favorite Folders and Apps to the Start Screen in Windows 8</a></span></p><p>Fused Deposition Modelling <a href=#>3D printers</a>, which is currently the most common 3D printer on the market, use thermoplastics. A filament of the plastic is fed through an extruder and the printer creates its product in layers that rapidly cool and solidify.</p><h2 id=what-about-polyurethane>What About Polyurethane?</h2><p>Polyurethane (PU) refers to a class of organic polymers that are joined by urethane links. "Organic" in this case refers to organic chemistry, which centers around carbon compounds. Carbon is the basis for life as we know it, hence the name.</p><p>One of the things that make polyurethane special is that it's not a specific chemical compound. Polyurethane can be made from a number of different monomers. This is why it's a "class" of polymers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/foam-rolls.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because you can make PU from different materials, it means that different PUs have different properties. Most polyurethane is made into foam, such as kitchen sponges.</p><h2 id=why-tpu-is-great-for-protecting-devices>Why TPU Is Great for Protecting Devices</h2><p>Although TPU is made from a variety of materials, products made from TPU generally have elasticity, transparency, and low weight. TPU can be quite thin and retain its strength. The combination of elasticity and strength makes TPU a good choice for protective cases since the material won't crack, tear, or break under the types of forces a <a href=#>dropped device</a> is normally subjected to.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is MIL-SPEC Drop Protection?</a></span></p><p>Another bonus property of TPU is its strong resistance to oils and liquids. So the natural oil and sweat from your fingers shouldn't stain it!</p><h2 id=tpu-is-everywhere>TPU Is Everywhere</h2><p>TPU has such a wide range of applications that you almost certainly have a lot of the stuff lying around. Car dashboard panels, power tools casings, hoses, tubes, cable sleeves, shoes, and more are made from or use TPU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also a fine choice for a smartphone case material, but your phone is already made from some incredible materials such as polycarbonate and <a href=#>Gorilla Glass</a>. So perhaps you don't have to make the choice at all, and can be one of the brave folks that go <a href=#>caseless</a>. On the other hand, if you really love customizing your phone's look, there's an argument to be made for having <a href=#>multiple phone cases</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why You Should Use Multiple Phone Cases</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhucXBjaX9ww8eaq2aho2LBqbHRpqappJGowaqvjKmmpbGlp7K1tMCnnGasoKp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

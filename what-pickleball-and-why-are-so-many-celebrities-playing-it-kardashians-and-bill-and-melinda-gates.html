The Kardashians and Bill and Melinda</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you were wondering what Stephen Colbert is doing with CBS by hosting “Pickled” today on November 17, chances are you might also have questions about that new, weird racket sport that is taking Hollywood and social media by storm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pickleball is the fastest growing sport in the US, with 4.8 million players in the country as of last year, growing 11.5 per cent on average over the last five years. It’s a Frankenstein’s monster of racket sports as it’s played in a tennis-like fashion on a badminton court with paddles and a plastic, perforated whiffle ball.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/17/5b606403-5d98-47c0-aec7-305cbf6e4a0d_191ec1ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The game comes with its own terminology and quirky slang (“dink”, “falafel” and “flapjack” are worth their own Google searches) but essentially, players take turns serving and scoring, the sport can be played in a singles or doubles format, and there are rules to prevent excessively fast play – only underhand serves are permitted and the “kitchen” is a zone near the net that players are not allowed to volley from.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Dennis Rodman’s record-breaking football star daughter, Trinity Rodman</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Particularly in the last two years as people searched for outdoor activities during the Covid-19 pandemic, A-listers and professional athletes playing the sport have only increased the mania around it.</p>This is all coming to a head as Colbert hosts his celebrity doubles pickleball tournament, which features duos involving <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Emma Watson</span></a>, Daniel Dae Kim, Luis Guzmán and Sugar Ray Leonard. And these aren’t even close to the biggest names to support the odd sport.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What started out as a suburban pastime invented by kids in Bainbridge Island, gradually began to hit its stride in the mid-2010s when the US Pickleball National Championships relocated to Palm Springs, California and the US Open Pickleball Championships were first held in Naples, Florida in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/17/87c18a39-6d35-4d0d-9d89-166435883f0b_9755511d.jpg>Celebrities thereafter turned to the sport as a pastime as Bill and Melinda Gates (who have played since childhood), Leonardo DiCaprio, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">George and Amal Clooney</span></a>, the Kardashians, Jamie Foxx, Will Smith and Ellen DeGeneres revealed their obsession with the sport in recent years. The Covid-19 pandemic also helped the sport along as people sought alternatives to indoor activities in the spacious US.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">She’s back! Melania Trump’s return to the spotlight … alongside Donald</span></p></a></h3>Athletes close to or past retirement have also picked up the sport. NFL quarterbacks <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tom Brady</span></a> and Eli Manning, former tennis world No 1 Andre Agassi and Olympic Men’s swimming gold medal repository Michael Phelps are just some of the mainstays in pro-am and celebrity exhibition matches, usually in the doubles format.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But why is the sport so attractive as a pastime?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The USA Pickleball Association’s 2021 fact sheet reflects that the relaxed pace of the sport is preferred by older folks. The average age for casual players is 33.6 years old, the average age of core players (those who play more than eight times a year) is 47.5 years old, with the bulk of core players being older than 65 years old, making up 33.7 per cent of the core player population.</p>However, that has not stopped pickleball from going from casual hobby to cash cow. Established in 2021, Major League Pickleball is expected to expand its roster of teams from 12 to 16, and to award up to US$2 million in cash prizes. NBA superstars <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">LeBron James</span></a>, Draymond Green, Kevin Love and Kevin Durant have joined Brady and former women’s tennis world No 1 Kim Clijsters as owners of professional pickleball clubs too.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">10 richest football stars of 2022: net worths, ranked – from Neymar to Messi</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/17/9fdebbc9-b712-461e-be87-e80f90c03ae0_4a57a49f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But whether you’re trying to go pro in the US, or if you’re just trying to see what Leo and the Kardashians are making such a fuss about, the sport has plenty of appeal as it gives racket-sport-lovers the mobility and singles/doubles formats of tennis with the light racket work of badminton, and the high-speed volleys from ping pong. It’s playable on a badminton court with a low net, and only needs two to four paddles and a plastic perforated ball.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With all the A-list support and investment to boot, we would not be caught by surprise if this wacky game made it all the way to a future summer Olympics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxocnFpbX9ww8eaq2aomZi4rbHBmqOlZZGjsW7Dx7JkmqqVYsCwecyapbJlk5q5pq7RoquinaNiva2t2KKloGWZqXqsrdGdmKygmZa7tHnAp5tmmpmhuW6tzZ1kpp2cnrulrYygmK2dow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

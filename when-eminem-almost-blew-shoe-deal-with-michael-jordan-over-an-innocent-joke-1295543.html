However, the partnership route was not straightforward.&nbsp;In an April 2020 interview with Sway on SiriusXM Shade 45, star rapper Eminem recounted the experience where he almost blew a shoe deal with Michael Jordan over a joke. Apparently, Eminem was discussing a potential collaboration on a shoe with Michael Jordan over the phone. Things were going well, and the rapper thought the Chicago Bulls legend seemed cool.</p><p>However, at the end of the call, Eminem, perhaps trying to lighten the mood, made a playful remark. He jokingly asked Jordan, "Yo, man, when are you gonna come to Detroit so I can dunk on you?" The joke landed with a thud. There was silence on the other end of the line. Eminem worried he'd offended Jordan and blown the deal.</p><p>Luckily, things turned out alright. While Eminem fretted, the deal went through.&nbsp; Eminem has even collaborated on several Air Jordan shoes since then, though some were limited releases.</p><br><h2 id=661cca40d1533>Eminem X Air Jordan&nbsp;</h2><p>Eminem has collaborated on several Air Jordan shoes throughout his career.&nbsp; <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><strong>1.

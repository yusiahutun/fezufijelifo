White sneakers are a perfect example. To me, white sneakers are to spring and summer what knee-high boots are to fall and winter: staples you can virtually style with everything and anything, which fit within the overall aesthetic of these specific seasons, and no warm-weather wardrobe is complete without white sneaker outfits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At some point in the last two years, I became somewhat of a sneakerhead. I've started meticulously crafting a capsule wardrobe of fresh kicks, which now includes a white pair of sneakers by Sam Edelman. The first white pair of sneakers I've owned as an adult, these shoes pair well with just about everything, including blazers, dresses, denim, and leggings. To unironically quote 2004's&nbsp;Mean Girls, the limit does not exist when it comes to the endless white sneaker combinations you can put together with a quick skim of your wardrobe.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, we understand how daunting it can be when wearing such a classic, crip white shoe, particularly if you're afraid your footwear will attract more attention or accidentally get super dirty (in which case, there are plenty of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ways to clean them up</a>). Whatever the hesitation, I can guarantee that once you slip on a pair of white sneakers, your wardrobe will feel complete.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still doubting the shoe's versatility? We scoured Instagram for some examples below of white sneaker outfits you most likely already own.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-to-enhance-athleisure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>To Enhance Athleisure</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I know what you're thinking, "duh," right? But hear me out: White sneakers are the easiest way to elevate your athleisure, and that goes for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>all&nbsp;athleisure</a>, be it a matching sports bra and leggings set, a graphic tee and shorts, or sweats. A fresh pair will brighten up your outfit, while beat-up kicks and tube socks add vintage flair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-as-a-substitute-for-heels></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>As a Substitute for Heels</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oftentimes, people feel that a dress calls for formal(ish) footwear, but this is a myth I'm here to debunk. I've been a fan of the sneakers and dresses (or skirts) look ever since Sandra Bullock sported the aesthetic in the 1998 film&nbsp;Practical Magic&nbsp;and, personally, think this is one&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>'90s fashion trend</a>&nbsp;worth adopting permanently. So, trade in your flats for a pair of cross-trainers or tennis shoes for a laid-back look that's also really comfortable (because, let's be honest, are we actually ready to go back to wearing heels?).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-to-contrast-a-monochromatic-outfit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>To Contrast a Monochromatic Outfit</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As much as I love a matching moment, I'm also kind of tired of all the&nbsp;monochromatic loungewear&nbsp;I've collected since the start of the pandemic. If you, like me, are looking for some hint of contrast to break up the singular color palette (because if we have these sets, we might as well wear them), throw on a pair of white sneakers as you're heading out the door.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jeans-and-a-white-tee></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jeans and a White Tee</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A clean pair of white sneakers paired with a crisp white tee and blue jeans is a simple outfit that's stood the test of time for a reason: Coordinating your top to your footwear adds a subtle element of synchronization to your outfit â€” you're still holding on to the matchy-matchy aesthetic without going overboard. What's more, the classic combination of blue jeans and a white tee is simple and lax. However, if you're meticulous with your proportions,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skinny jeans</a>&nbsp;with a tucked-in oversized T-shirt or baggy jeans with a form-fitting top can look very put together.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-all-denim></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With All-Denim</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Canadian tuxedo is monochromatic by design, so, like matching sweat sets, it could use a bit of contrast, and there are a few different ways you can go about achieving this. For example,&nbsp;Katy Perry wore a tan Canadian tuxedo&nbsp;for a '70s twist on the traditional blue jean aesthetic, Gwen Stefani donned denim-on-denim with a pair of checkered slip-ons, and&nbsp;Jennifer Lopez wore a Canadian tuxedo&nbsp;courtside with black stiletto buckle boots as her choice of footwear. You can opt for plain white sneakers to keep things simple yet classic.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-as-an-alternative-to-flip-flops></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>As an Alternative to Flip-Flops</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Packing for spring break or collecting items for summer vacation? Flip-flops are a must if you're heading to the beach, but if you're strolling along the boardwalk, reserve open-toe pairs for the sand and swap in white sneakers to go with your shorts and tank tops. White sneakers are multi-faceted shoes, so tossing them in your suitcase will save you space; plus, you won't need five other shoe options for day-to-night looks.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-as-a-neutral></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>As a Neutral</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your outfit consists of a bold accessory or print that's meant to be the focal point of your 'fit, white sneakers bring a neutral element, letting the most colorful aspect of the ensemble shine the brightest.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-with-a-blazer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>With a Blazer</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This pairing understands the "business casual" assignment. Professional on top and laid back on the bottom, a pair of white sneakers with a blazer says, "I'm cool, calm, and collected." However, if you need to make a beeline for the exit, you're out the door quicker than you would be in heels.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571qGgrZ1dqLumrcqeqWanpamzqsDSZmxsbWlsgno%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

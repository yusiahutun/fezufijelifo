Some may still be attached to the branches of forest trees, he adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gale has spent more than a decade spearheading orchid conservation in the region, his research leading to the reintroduction of rare plants and improved understanding of the threats they face in the wild, including genetic erosion and poaching to feed the illegal trade in them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In 2018, we published a study based on research where we visited markets across south China – from Yunnan to Hong Kong,” he says. “The results were pretty depressing – we estimated that about 1.5 million plants are traded illegally every year.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/22/c8f4481f-9d2c-471c-9958-9f56b14d8268_a6c1f945.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The volume of illegally traded orchids in Hong Kong, Gale says, is quite small. And things have improved over the years, with fewer being sold at markets. “You have to look a bit harder to find them,” he adds.</p>The import and export of wild orchids is restricted in Hong Kong under the Cites (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) treaty which <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">protects endangered plants and animals</span></a>. Those breaking the law face a maximum fine of HK$100,000 (US$12,800) and a year’s imprisonment.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gale says he has not heard of a single enforcement case in Hong Kong involving the illegal trade of wild orchids.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the illegal trade over the border in China is “eye-watering”, Gale says, progress has been made in the past couple of years. “The mainland government has done a lot more to protect wild orchids by including more as protected species,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/22/27a6a622-0ddd-4aca-a5cb-575805ed1abc_e9389816.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At KFBG, research focuses not only on orchids in their natural environment but on conserving species outside their natural habitats. This allows KFBG researchers to raise juvenile orchid plants to reintroduce them to the wild on the KFBG site to help foster new, healthy populations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its staff give the pollination process a helping hand by basically doing the job that insects do in the wild.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When people imagine an orchid they think of the big colourful blooms you see in the Mong Kok flower market. But the reality is that, for many wild orchids, the flowers are quite small.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“To carry out hand pollination, you have to access a part of the flower that’s microscopic, often less than a millimetre in diameter,” Gale says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/22/87e1dff7-3818-402f-ae20-e4be28d25046_97025ec5.jpg>A fine, precise tool like a needle is required to transfer the pollen. Gale has even used a naturally fallen sharp quill from an <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">East Asian porcupine</span></a>, one of the many animal species found wandering the KFBG grounds.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Orchids have inspired historians, artists and poets for centuries. During China’s Song dynasty (960–1279) the delicate Cymbidium species was the focus of paintings, with artists depicting them with detailed outlines and colour in a process known as gongbi – painting with detailed strokes.</p>British-born, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong-based botanical artist Sally Bunker</span></a> has drawn many orchids. Her illustrations are seen to best effect in Portraits of Trees of Hong Kong and Southern China, a book which was recently made available in Chinese.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/22/f2bf4486-6043-466b-be8f-ea49654976aa_bf9df333.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Painting an orchid is a challenge as these flowers are complex in design and colour,” says Bunker. A lot of patience is required, she says. Being a perfectionist can also help.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is said that with orchids, the flower formation and nature’s design have reached perfection, and the artist must try and convey this, and depict the essence of the flowers.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Nature Exploration – Orchid Encounters”, April 25, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, Lam Kam Road, Tai Po, New Territories.

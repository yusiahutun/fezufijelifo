I’d do anything for those kids.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So, what’s new about playing Joyce this season? “I feel like in the past, she’s trying to figure things out. She’s got the Ouija board on the wall, or [she’s] taping together Will’s drawings. Very crafty.” she explains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But this season, she is literally fighting for her survival and to save the people she loves. She doesn’t really have time to plan or use her critical thinking, which was really fun as an actress, actually.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/31/85008aee-078e-4344-bb23-00787868d028_7e483640.jpg>Having experienced first-hand a lot of what the young characters in the show do – from <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">listening to music on a Walkman</span></a> to hanging out in roller rinks – Ryder says the past four seasons had evoked a sense of nostalgia for her.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In season one, there was a record player, and some of the kids didn’t know what it was. I had to explain what records were,” she says with a laugh. “That was wild to me. And also explaining rotary phones, they just didn’t grow up with them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But I really related to the kids and was super protective of them because I had been doing that, working on films at their age.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/31/4aae67bc-6119-445b-b8db-d40b36313b5f_8746ae60.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Would she have done something like Stranger Things in her teenage Beetlejuice/ Heathers years?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If Stranger Things was around then, the nostalgia would be like the 1960s? I don’t know,” she says, while pondering aloud. “I was very like my character in Beetlejuice; they actually didn’t have to do a lot to me. I was very pale, I had that hair and I was very monotone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s why I credit Tim Burton with giving me a career: I was never the first choice for any of those movies in the ’80s.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/31/d0392008-0eb1-47c9-b6bb-91c761cf3402_bf8bc57a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gen X has been labelled the “forgotten generation” between baby boomers and millennials/Gen Z, and it’s something that the actress (regarded as an Gen X icon) feels relieved about.</p>“It’s so weird. I just remember we very purposely never said ‘<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Gen X</span></a>’ in [1994 film] Reality Bites, even though it’s associated with that expression. That was this label they slapped on us, but then it really caught on,” Ryder says.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[But] I will say this: I’m super grateful that I didn’t grow up with the internet and social media. I don’t think that I could have been an actress if everything was that exposed. It would’ve just flipped me out. There’s a lot of young people who just can’t even imagine a world without the internet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I remember the first time I called a boy. You practise, you’re so nervous and you write things down and get up the nerve. It was a real character-building thing. I was 14, and of course it was a disaster, but you learn how to get up the nerve. Kids don’t have to do that any more – they can construct witty texts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/31/6a57dacd-fe9f-45c4-b35e-c5b87d864bb2_28b56161.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, Ryder would be down for joining the Beetlejuice sequel that’s rumoured to be in the works.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m really hopeful that it’ll happen,” she says. “The only way we would do it is if everything was perfect and we had all the people – obviously Michael [Keaton] and obviously Tim. That’s what I love about Tim. He’s such a perfectionist. He can’t do something unless it’s completely his vision.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’ll happen if it can happen the perfect way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkHBwcWtgZMSqus6nmGaqqZmys3nSnpisp55igW66xK2dpaGoqHq0wNGapaCdomLBqbXNoKpmmpWawa2xya6gnJ0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The couple wed in March 2007.</p><p>In an ironic twist of life imitating art, Heinle and Luckinbill's characters on the show became a couple, had a child and then split. Their characters' son Reed Hellstrom (played by newcomer Tristan Lake Leabu) just returned to the "Y&R" canvas as a teenager, leading to speculation by fans that Luckinbill's JT might also return to the series.</p><p>Heinle and Luckinbill share two children -- Thaddeus, age 10, and Georgia, age 8.</p><p>Luckinbill is seeking joint custody of the children and is asking the court to "reserve for future determination the issue of spousal support," according to the filing.</p><p>She was previously married to "NCIS" star Michael Weatherly, whom she also shares a son named August. Weatherly and Heinle met while they were both starring as Coop and Steffy on ABC's now-defunct soap "Loving."</p><p>The actress just won her second Emmy this past year for her role as Victoria on "Y&R," which she's played since 2005. Luckinbill is most recently listed as an executive producer of the award-winning "La La Land," which almost won Best Picture during <a href=#>the Oscar fail heard around the world</a>.</p><p><strong>See more TooFab stories</strong>:</p><p><a href=#><strong>Arianne Zucker, Soap Star at Center of Donald Trump Tapes, Leaving 'Days of our Lives'</strong></a></p><p><a href=#><strong>'Real Housewives' Erika Girardi Talks 'Young and the Restless' Cameo: 'I Was Crawling Out of My Skin!'</strong></a></p><p><a href=#><strong>Behind the Scenes of Amazon's 'Tainted Dreams' With 'Big Brother' Alum Jessie Godderz (Exclusive Video)</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7j2xmaWlfrry2usZmmKecXam1pnnRnqqtpJWowG6%2F05qpZpmdmrmqrYyhnKKmnJp6orrDZqOaZZyWeq2tzZ1kqaqfmcKksdFmq6GZlGK5tq%2FKoqWboZyherW7jJ2gr6eimLJurcWtnKtlYWV6urHAq6pmp5ZiuqK%2B0aKYoJ1dmsWkuNSsoK%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

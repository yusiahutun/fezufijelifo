I remember going ‘Oh my God, I want that too. I want to go up there on the stage where it’s all lit up.’”</p><p>Keaton’s mom, Dorothy, went on to win the Mrs. Los Angeles for Homemakers title, but due to the family move to Santa Ana, her future title ambitions were shattered. “That was the end of it. Life changes.”</p><p>But it was the theatricality of the events and then Dorothy’s unfortunate circumstances, ending her dreams, that inspired Keaton to pursue an acting career. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I saw what my mother went through</a>”, Keaton told AARP. “I wanted to be famous. I wanted to be a movie star.” And so she has, beginning as an understudy in 1968 for the part of Sheila in Hair!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-2630192-edited.jpg><p>Born Diane Hall in Los Angeles, the now 78 year-old actress has received many accolades over her five decade career and was honored with both the Film Society of Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 2007 and an AFI Life Achievement Award in 2017.</p><p>But acting wasn’t always front and center stage for Diane, who changed her name surname to Keaton (her mother’s maiden name) as there was another actress with the name Diane Hall. For a short time, Keaton moonlighted at Manhattan nightclubs with her own singing act in order to support herself, revisiting this act in Annie Hall and later in And So It Goes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-517432044-edited.jpg><p>Though the actress has had several high profile relationships, she has never married, though the lack of a partner didn’t deter her from having a family. In her 50s, she adopted daughter Dexter (28) and son Duke (23), and raised them on her own.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>16 hit movies featuring a young Diane Keaton</h2><p>Here’s a look back at some notable films with a young Diane Keaton, from 1972’s The Godfather through 1999’s The Other Sister.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Godfather Series (1972, 1974, 1990)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/the-godfather_NpVzcO-edited.jpg><p>Clearly this was Keaton’s breakthrough role as Kay Adams, girlfriend and eventual wife of mob boss don Michael Corleone (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Al Pacino</a>) in this series about mafia life and crime.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I didn’t even know what The Godfather was</a>”, she recalls, despite the fact that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Puzo</a> novel the films were based on had spent 67 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. “Someone said to me that I have to go and audition for things, so I did for this film and I got the role.”</p><p>Up until this time, Keaton was known for her comedic timing and never had been cast in a drama. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">That was the strangest thing to ever happen to me in my whole life</a>.” Her role as Kay Adams evolved and in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, her character became more embittered about her husband’s crime empire.</p><p>Keaton stood out in all three films as the quiet woman necessary in the male dominated movies. The chemistry between Keaton and Pacino is palpable, so much so that the two began a personal relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sleeper (1973)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-50833874-edited.jpg><p>Some critics said this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Woody Allen</a> comedy was way ahead of its time with talk about futuristic sex. Allen is Miles Monroe, a nebbishy clarinet player who runs a health food store in Greenwich Village. He’s cryogenically frozen only to awaken 200 years in the future. Keaton stars as Luna Schlosser, who really dislikes Miles. If you’re not a Woody fan, watch the film just to enjoy Keaton’s Marlon Brando impression.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Marlon Brando Young : A Look Back at the Hollywood Bad Boy of the ’50s and ’60s</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Love and Death (1975)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/GettyImages-1262746724-e1704984742130.jpg><p>Another Allen and Keaton pairing in this lesser known Russian comedy film where she plays Sonja. The duo come up with a plot to assassinate Napoleon while making fun of foreign films and Russian literature.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Annie Hall (1977)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-618418558-edited.jpg><p>Dressed in the finest of vintage menswear, Keaton was absolutely spectacular as Annie Hall, a character in a relatable and ambitious relationship with Alvy Singer (Woody Allen). For her portrayal of Hall, Keaton took home the Oscar for Best Actress in this romantic comedy and the film won Best Picture.</p><p>Allen supposedly wrote the Hall character based on his personal relationship with Keaton. The film, which broke the fourth wall to allow the characters to talk directly to the audience, showcased Keaton’s golden shiksa persona and her talents to play ditzy, but also a complicated and intelligent woman. Not an easy task.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-526901142-edited.jpg><p>Looking for a way to switch gears from comedy to drama, she found Mr. Goodbar. Based on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Judith Rossner</a> novel, the film gave Keaton a chance to show a serious side to her talent. She played Theresa, a successful teacher for deaf children during the day who spends nights cruising singles bars and engaging in dangerous promiscuous sex. Not a remarkable film, but starring alongside young Diane Keaton was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Gere</a>. It did wrestle with feminism, drug use and double standards among men and women.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Interiors (1978)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-2893912-edited.jpg><p>Keaton’s character is one of three daughters who come to their mother’s aid after a emotional breakdown, this despite the fact that each of them have their own difficulties in life. Keaton plays Renata, the oldest sister, a poet and married to Frederick, a struggling writer who feels lessened by Renata’s success. This is Allen’s first full-fledged drama and received critical acclaim and numerous award nominations.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Manhattan (1979)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/manhattan_0JuG4C-edited.jpg><p>With this film, Keaton and Woody Allen ended their long working relationship until 1993. Filmed in Allen’s favorite city, New York, the movie explores the complexities of relationships. Starring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mariel Hemingway</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meryl Streep</a>, it’s Diane Keaton who shines in one of her best love stories.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>8 Mature Romance Movies That Will Make You Swoon in the Best Possible Way</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reds (1981)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-607403264-edited.jpg><p>Upon becoming romantically involved with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Warren Beatty</a>, Keaton was cast in his epic historical drama. She plays Louise Bryant, a journalist and feminist who flees her husband to work with radical journalist John Reed (Beatty).</p><p><strong>MUST-READ: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Annette Bening and Warren Beatty: The Secrets of Hollywood’s Ultimate Power Couple</a></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Nicholson</a> also starred as playwright Eugene O’Neill, marking Keaton’s first collaboration with him. Don’t anticipate much humor in this Keaton role, but her natural nervousness and beauty shines through.&nbsp;Keaton told Vanity Fair of the role: “It was that of everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary…. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I knew what it felt like to be extremely insecure</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shoot the Moon (1982)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/shoot-the-moon_5d6cae62-edited.jpg><p>The film follows a couple whose deteriorating marriage, separation and love affairs devastate their four children.&nbsp;Starring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Albert Finney</a> as George and Keaton as Faith Dunlap, her performance — especially an emotional scene singing in the tub — was hailed by critics and garnered her a second Golden Globe nomination in a row for Best Actress, following Reds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mrs. Soffel (1984)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-159834390-edited.jpg><p>Based on a true story, a repressed prison warden’s wife – Keaton – falls in love with a death row convicted murderer (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mel Gibson</a>) and, believing of his innocence, helps him and his brother escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Crimes of the Heart (1986)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-125343090-edited.jpg><p>The cast of this film reads like a who’s who in Hollywood: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Lange</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sissy Spacek</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Shepard</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tess Harper</a> and Diane Keaton. The story focuses on three troubled sisters who reunite after Babe (Spacek) shoots her husband. Their reunion is joyful after not being together for awhile, but the time together stirs up much tension. Keaton moves seamlessly from New York neurotic characters to southern quirky.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Baby Boom (1987)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/baby-boom_aeca587f.jpg><p>Keaton plays J. C. Wiatt, an ultra-feminine Manhattan business exec who is suddenly forced to care for a toddler she has inherited. In response, Wiatt begins reevaluates her priorities and her life to come to terms with her situation as an overnight parent. While Keaton brought all her charm and nervous attitude to the role, some critics said it reinforced the stereotype of women having to choose between domesticity and a career.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Father of the Bride (1991) and Part II (1995)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/father-of-the-bride_c780af4d-edited.jpg><p>Here come the 90s and Keaton has established herself as a more mature actress, frequently cast as matriarchs. In this comedy and its sequel co-starring <a href=#>Steve Martin</a>, Keaton welcomed her first major hit after four years of box office disappointments. In this rom-com, Keaton and Martin play Nina and George Banks.</p><p>George has a difficult time accepting his daughter Annie (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kimberly Williams-Paisley</a>) will be moving out in the original movie, while also coping with the burgeoning costs of her wedding. In the sequel, Nina becomes pregnant in middle age at the same time as her daughter. Critics hailed Keaton’s new film persona, comparing her to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katharine Hepburn</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-169244386-edited.jpg><p>After a break in their working relationship, Keaton and Allen once again star in this black comedy mystery. Their ditzy chemistry is still there as Larry and Carol, semi-normal New Yorkers. Carol becomes suspicious of her neighbor down the hall when his wife suddenly dies and he’s all too cheery to move on. In response, she begins investigating and Larry reluctantly agrees to help her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The First Wives Club (1996)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-1140120-edited-1.jpg><p>This highly successful film partnered Keaton with <a href=#>Bette Midler</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Goldie Hawn</a> as a trio of middle-aged “first wives” who had been divorced and replaced by younger women. The film developed a cult following among middle-aged women and is still a favorite with that age group who love to watch women have their moment.</p><p>As the group seeks revenge on their husbands, there are lots of laughs and even some tears. You can’t help but smile with their rousing rendition of “You Don’t Own Me” sung by the trio. Keaton looked superb as the replaced first wife.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Goldie Hawn Young: Incredible Retro Photos That You Have to See To Believe</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Other Sister (1999)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-909088-edited.jpg><p>The last film Keaton made in the preceding century was with co-stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Juliette Lewis</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Paulson</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Montgomery</a>. The latter two and Keaton are overbearing sisters to Lewis’ Carla Tate.

In fact, mobile technology has made it far easier for people to indulge in these sorts of behaviours.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/03/39702d86-d22c-4fb3-ac47-5063a58c7cbd_899780ef.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you are thinking of using stalkerware, Deschemin recommends that you ask yourself a few questions first.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How would you feel if someone spied on you? Are you willing to destroy the relationship over your suspicions? And what are the reasons for your lack of trust?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The more you deal with the uncomfortable feelings that have led you to consider using spyware, the more rational you will become,” she says. “Chances are that you will refrain from using such spyware because you know you will be compromising the most important ingredient in your relationship: trust.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/03/4804b992-f4b2-4fd5-aba2-48fc59fa8873_e3cb3c5d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But what if you are being spied on? What should you do?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are many reasons why a partner spies on the other person. Their insecurity might stem from their own past experiences or from their partner’s past behaviour,” Deschemin says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can discuss where the insecurity comes from and work from there. Make sure to respond to their feelings instead of putting them down. After this, you should establish boundaries and let the other person know that snooping is unacceptable. Then you can set a time frame for how long you are willing to work through it and rebuild the trust. If it goes nowhere, you should seek couples’ therapy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For the person who has used stalkerware, I would recommend working on overcoming their sense of insecurity,” she concludes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/03/86d22b41-770c-45f0-92cc-b3db9f02066f_e18049fa.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some spies might excuse their behaviour by saying they want to trust their spouse more or feel more secure about their relationship, reasons Deschemin disagrees with.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What is trust? It is the belief that someone can be relied on. It is critical in any meaningful relationship, be it romantic, filial or friendship. The most important benefit of trust is a sense of security and ease.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Therefore, those who spy on their partners do it out of a sense of insecurity. I would urge those who feel the need to spy on their partner to work on the source of their insecurity instead of feeding it.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Virtual dating apps: don’t get too caught up in the metaverse</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Insecurity does not only rear its ugly head in romantic relationships – it also leads to erratic, clingy and unpredictable behaviours that push away people. So instead of focusing on a ‘quick fix’ like spyware, I would recommend building a foundation of security and positive attachments. The benefits will only multiply over time.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As cliché as it sounds, trust also requires something of a leap of faith on our part. After all, if one of the basic foundations of a relationship is trust, and we go into every single relationship assuming that our partner is not to be trusted, then how can the relationship grow?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Luisa Tam is a Post correspondent who also hosts video tutorials on Cantonese language that are now part of Cathay Pacific’s in-flight entertainment programme</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiucilsGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaCofKK%2B06KapZ1faH53hY9tbmixn6q%2Fbr%2FPqKysnV2ovbq1zaBksqelYryzecCrnGaxn6p6tLrOqKeippdixrDB0WaqqA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PeakVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

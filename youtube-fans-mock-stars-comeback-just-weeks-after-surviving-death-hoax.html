The young <a href=#>influencer</a> would boast she was the “youngest flexer of the century.” Her new <a href=#>music</a> has raised eyebrows as it comes after she was the <a href=#>center of a death hoax</a>. Fans have gone to the stretch of claiming the entire chapter was a PR stunt – but Lil Tay broke her silence over the ordeal.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-03-at-6.59.05-PM-1024x721.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-mock-youtube-star-lil-tay-s-comeback>Fans mock YouTube star Lil Tay’s comeback</h2><p>YouTuber Lil Tay dropped her new <a href=#>music</a> video Sucker 4 Green on October 1st which is partially written and directed by the young artist herself. While listeners were relieved to see the artist coming back to her full form after surviving a death hoax, her video was flooded with comments. Most followed the “we making it out” trend where fans mockingly wrote, “We making it out alive with this one.”</p><p>For the unversed, “we making it out of hood” is a trend that started a few years back. It became really popular in February 2023. Fans leave positive comments on music videos that are worthy of praise, saying, “We making it out of the hood with this one.”</p><p>Others use it as a joke, when something they class as not being very good. The phrase is used to jest the music is a ‘game-changer’, when it’s not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-03-at-7.00.48-PM-1024x754.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-tay-s-music-video-gets-mixed-responses>Lil Tay’s music video gets mixed responses</h2><p>While some called the song iconic, others were suspicious the death hoax was too close to her releasing new music.</p><p>One fan posted on X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>): “Lil Tay after dropping the publicity stunt of the century and coming back with a banger!”</p><p>Another echoed the sentiment, writing: “LIL TAY????

Lil Tay is low-key iconic for this!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-death-hoax-leaves-her-heartbroken>Death hoax leaves her ‘heartbroken’</h2><p>At the time, 24 hours after her <a href=#>Instagram</a> account was ‘hacked’, the little star spoke out.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking</a> to TMZ, the teen said: “I want to make it clear that my brother and I are safe and alive, but I’m completely heartbroken, and struggling to even find the right words to say.</p><p>“It’s been a very traumatizing 24 hours. All day yesterday, I was bombarded with endless heartbreaking and tearful phone calls from loved ones all while trying to sort out this mess.</p><p>“My Instagram account was compromised by a 3rd party and used to spread jarring misinformation and rumors regarding me, to the point that even my name was wrong.
